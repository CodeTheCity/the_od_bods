There are 8 Areas of Great Landscape Value (AGLV’s) in Moray.Moray enjoys a high quality landscape and proposals which are likely to result in a significant adverse impact on the landscape will not be supported. The creation of new hill tracks can have a significant impact primarily from the visual appearance of the new track, but also from the drainage and erosion effects on the local area.</td>

Proposals associated with any other location will be dealt with under H7 (LDP2015), and assessed against criteria such as visual prominence; character; settlement pattern; build up. Boundaries have been drawn around these groupings, and there will be a presumption in favour of developments within this boundary. (The settlement boundary policy E9 (LDP2015) will apply).The concept of identifying and promoting rural development in existing “rural communities” was originally contained in the 1993-98 Plan. At that time they were identified as small rural settlements, which served as social focal points for the surrounding area, with the presence of one or more community facilities (school/hall/shop). In subsequent Plans, the requirement for community facilities has been reduced, and further groupings have been designated based on their status as a cohesive, physical grouping. Consolidation of these remains the preference.</td>
