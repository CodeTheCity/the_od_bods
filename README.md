# the_od_bods
The aim of this project at [CTC23](https://github.com/CodeTheCity/CTC23) is to collate access to Open Data in Scotland, beginning with cities. 

## Methodology

We started by looking at Scottish Cities' open data portals (where these could be found). 


## What we are building

- A list of data sources and what they contain
 - script to pull data from existing platforms
