The Contracts Register is based on information and supporting documentation provided by Budget Holders and will continually undergo a verification process by Aberdeen City Council's **Commercial and Procurement Services**.

The Contracts Register is available on [Aberdeen City Council's website](https://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/services/council-and-democracy/financial-information-and-procurement/contracts-register) as a pdf document.  The same details are provided here as open data to increase the accessibility of this information.

G. Pope.  In early 1925, forms were sent to each householder in Aberdeen asking for full details of those relatives who had fallen during the conflict.  For military personnel, the details included rank, regiment and any military honours.  The forms also requested details of any non-combatants killed by enemy action and those in the **Mercantile Marine** (Merchant Navy - commercial/civilian vessels and crews that were engaged in activity supporting the Nation during times of war or those requisitioned and reassigned to military duties, such as minesweeping). The WWI Roll also drew together many separate lists provided by Churches, the University of Aberdeen, schools, guilds and businesses. The City Assessor was responsible for ensuring that no duplications existed. The final copy of the Roll contained over five thousand names.   
    
Later, two dedicated volumes were created to commemorate lives lost during **World War II**. Volume One: **HM Forces and the Merchant Navy** and Volume Two: **Civil Defence and Civilians**. The separate volumes record slightly different information.    
    
The **Post-1945** Roll varies in intent from the WWI and WWII volumes. This volume is hand-written, and records HM Forces lives lost in conflict and during active service, so includes those who lost their lives in Northern Ireland, for example.    
    
The transcripts are an attempt to provide a structure to the data recorded in the City’s Rolls of Honour. Original copies of the WWI volume can be accessed in the Central Library, Aberdeen Art Gallery, and the Aberdeen City Archives. The WWII and Post-1945 volumes can be viewed in Aberdeen Art Gallery (McBey library on Level 1).

In 1970, at the start of his career, one of his outfits was selected by Vogue magazine as **Dress of the Year**. Two years later he formed his own fashion house, **Bill Gibb Ltd**, and launched his first solo collection to critical acclaim. His designs were applauded for their startling combinations of colour, texture and pattern. Collaborating with knitwear designer Kaffe Fassett, he created a signature style of layered knits for women. Gibb also gained a reputation for romantic grandeur, dressing celebrities such as model Twiggy and popstars Lulu and Cilla Black. He continued to design for private clients until his death.   
   
In 1997 his archive of sketched designs and swatches was bought by Aberdeen City Council: Museums and Gallery with help from supporters including the **Friends of Aberdeen Art Gallery and Museums**. We continue to add to the collection of outfits and accessories designed by Bill Gibb, and currently hold more than 100 items of clothing, plus numerous other items associated with him.

The majority of the Aberdeen City area falls within 2 constituencies:

- **Aberdeen North**
- **Aberdeen South**

Aberdeen City Council is responsible for organising general election ballots within these constituencies and is therefore able to share the election results (including votes cast per candidate and rejected ballots) as open data.  More information about elections and voting within Aberdeen is available on the [Council and Democracy section of the **Aberdeen City Council** website](https://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/services/council-and-democracy).

A large part of the north of Aberdeen City, including Dyce and some parts of Bucksburn, falls within the **Gordon** constituency where general election ballots are administrated by Aberdeenshire Council.  Detailed results for Gordon, and the other constituencies administrated by Aberdeenshire Council can be found on the [elections section of the Aberdeenshire Council website](https://www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/elections/).

## Alexa Voice Skills

Amazon Alexa, Google Home and other providers let coders write new skills for their home speakers.  

We took the school lunch menus and calendars and put together a really simple skill to find out what's on the menu.  If you already have an Amazon Alexa all you need to do to get started is;

* Search for Tayside Dinners and [enable the skill](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Andrew-Open-Dundee-Tayside-Dinners/dp/B074R5X41G/) for your Alexa
* Ask ""Tayside Dinners"" what's for lunch

That's all! 

Alexa will work out what day and week it is, and also remember whether you want the menu for primary or secondary schools.

## What's the code like?

We have [published the code for the voice skill on Github](https://github.com/DundeeCityCouncil/TaysideDinners)  so you can have a look and see how it works, feel free to let us know of any suggestions or issues and - and have a go at writing you own voice skill.

Deprivation in this context refers to the range of problems that arise due to the lack of resources or opportunities covering health, safety, education, employment, housing and access to services as well as financial aspects. 

The most recent Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation was released by the Scottish Government on 31st August 2016. The SIMD divides Scotland into 6,976 small areas called data zones with roughly an equal population in each data zone. The Scottish Government then look at the indicators to measure the different sides of deprivation in each data zone including pupil performance, travel times to GP’s, crime, unemployment etc. These 38 indicators of deprivation are then grouped into 7 types called domains. These domains are:

•	Income
•	Employment
•	Education
•	Health
•	Access to Services
•	Crime
•	Housing 

The 7 domains are combined into one SIMD, ranking each data zone in Scotland from 1 (Most Deprived) to 6,976 (Least Deprived). The SIMD allows organisations to target policies and place resources in the areas with greatest need. 

The boundaries used to collate the SIMD changed in 2016 as the analysis was based on the 2011 data zones which were produced by the Scottish Government.  The previous SIMD’s published by the Scottish Government were based on the Scottish Governments 2001 based data zones. This means that the data zones used in the 2016 SIMD are not directly comparable with previous data zones.

This dataset shows SIMD 2016 data for Dundee City. This is broken down to data zone and intermediate zone level. There are currently 188 data zones in Dundee City.

The data is sourced from Scottish Government - Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation 2016. The full dataset is available on the Scottish Government website which can be accessed from the link below:
https://www2.gov.scot/Topics/Statistics/SIMD

The Scottish Government have produced some useful documents to assist greater understanding of the SIMD.

**Outputs from the monitors feed into Stirling Council’s **[**Local Transport Strategy (LTS)**](https://www.stirling.gov.uk/roads-transport-streets/environment-friendly-transport/local-transport-strategy-documents/)**.**

**Cycle and pedestrian data are gathered using cabinets located at the side of footways and cycleways, which detect pedestrians using an infra-red beam, and cyclists using piezoelectric strips.  The devices used are encrypted, and anonymise any data collected, so no pedestrians or cyclists can be traced.**

**The movements which pass through the detection zone of the counters are classified based on which sensors are triggered by the movement.  Where the pedestrian infra-red beam is triggered but not the piezo electric strips, the movement is a pedestrian.  Where both the infra-red beam and the piezo electric strips are triggered, the movement is a cyclist.  The piezo electric strips are installed below the surface of the footway and so when cut, will fail to record anything.**

**In August 2019, the number of locations at which monitors are located increased to 23 with the addition of three sites around Craig’s Roundabout. These were installed to allow the figures generated from them to be combined with those from the Kerse Road Bridge to provide origin-destination data for the network of pathways going through the roundabout.**

**The devices that are used are encrypted, and anonymise any data collected. No vehicles can be traced.** 

**Journey times are calculated when one device is identified at two locations, this is referred to as a Bluetooth match.**

**The collection of journey times’ data can be effected by different activities and conditions.**

**•	There must be a minimum of five Bluetooth matches before the journey time can be generated**
 
**•	Road closures will skew outputs as vehicles will be using alternative routes** 

**•	Sensors can be moved to different sites therefore results will be zero until the locations are updated **

**•	Activity of the sensors can impact results. Normally the Bluetooth sensors are active between 7am and 7pm. However, if they receive up to two weeks of insufficient sunlight there can be unprecedented periods of inactivity**
