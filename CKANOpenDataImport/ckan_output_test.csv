Aberdeen City Rolls of Honour,Aberdeen,https://data.aberdeencity.gov.uk/dataset/aberdeen-city-rolls-of-honour,,04/08/2020 06:04:06,11/02/2020 14:02:02,,,,,,Open Government Licence 3.0 (United Kingdom),"The Roll of Honour for the **Great War** (later known as World War I or WWI) was compiled by the City Assessor, Mr H. G. Pope.  In early 1925, forms were sent to each householder in Aberdeen asking for full details of those relatives who had fallen during the conflict.  For military personnel, the details included rank, regiment and any military honours.  The forms also requested details of any non-combatants killed by enemy action and those in the **Mercantile Marine** (Merchant Navy - commercial/civilian vessels and crews that were engaged in activity supporting the Nation during times of war or those requisitioned and reassigned to military duties, such as minesweeping). The WWI Roll also drew together many separate lists provided by Churches, the University of Aberdeen, schools, guilds and businesses. The City Assessor was responsible for ensuring that no duplications existed. The final copy of the Roll contained over five thousand names.   
    
Later, two dedicated volumes were created to commemorate lives lost during **World War II**. Volume One: **HM Forces and the Merchant Navy** and Volume Two: **Civil Defence and Civilians**. The separate volumes record slightly different information.    
    
The **Post-1945** Roll varies in intent from the WWI and WWII volumes. This volume is hand-written, and records HM Forces lives lost in conflict and during active service, so includes those who lost their lives in Northern Ireland, for example.    
    
The transcripts are an attempt to provide a structure to the data recorded in the City’s Rolls of Honour. Original copies of the WWI volume can be accessed in the Central Library, Aberdeen Art Gallery, and the Aberdeen City Archives. The WWII and Post-1945 volumes can be viewed in Aberdeen Art Gallery (McBey library on Level 1).

In 1970, at the start of his career, one of his outfits was selected by Vogue magazine as **Dress of the Year**. Two years later he formed his own fashion house, **Bill Gibb Ltd**, and launched his first solo collection to critical acclaim. His designs were applauded for their startling combinations of colour, texture and pattern. Collaborating with knitwear designer Kaffe Fassett, he created a signature style of layered knits for women. Gibb also gained a reputation for romantic grandeur, dressing celebrities such as model Twiggy and popstars Lulu and Cilla Black. He continued to design for private clients until his death.   
   
In 1997 his archive of sketched designs and swatches was bought by Aberdeen City Council: Museums and Gallery with help from supporters including the **Friends of Aberdeen Art Gallery and Museums**. We continue to add to the collection of outfits and accessories designed by Bill Gibb, and currently hold more than 100 items of clothing, plus numerous other items associated with him.

The majority of the Aberdeen City area falls within 2 constituencies:

Aberdeen City Council is responsible for organising general election ballots within these constituencies and is therefore able to share the election results (including votes cast per candidate and rejected ballots) as open data.  More information about elections and voting within Aberdeen is available on the [Council and Democracy section of the **Aberdeen City Council** website](https://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/services/council-and-democracy).

A large part of the north of Aberdeen City, including Dyce and some parts of Bucksburn, falls within the **Gordon** constituency where general election ballots are administrated by Aberdeenshire Council.  Detailed results for Gordon, and the other constituencies administrated by Aberdeenshire Council can be found on the [elections section of the Aberdeenshire Council website](https://www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/elections/).
