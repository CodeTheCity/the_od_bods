G. Pope.  In early 1925, forms were sent to each householder in Aberdeen asking for full details of those relatives who had fallen during the conflict.  For military personnel, the details included rank, regiment and any military honours.  The forms also requested details of any non-combatants killed by enemy action and those in the **Mercantile Marine** (Merchant Navy - commercial/civilian vessels and crews that were engaged in activity supporting the Nation during times of war or those requisitioned and reassigned to military duties, such as minesweeping). The WWI Roll also drew together many separate lists provided by Churches, the University of Aberdeen, schools, guilds and businesses. The City Assessor was responsible for ensuring that no duplications existed. The final copy of the Roll contained over five thousand names.   
    
Later, two dedicated volumes were created to commemorate lives lost during **World War II**. Volume One: **HM Forces and the Merchant Navy** and Volume Two: **Civil Defence and Civilians**. The separate volumes record slightly different information.    
    
The **Post-1945** Roll varies in intent from the WWI and WWII volumes. This volume is hand-written, and records HM Forces lives lost in conflict and during active service, so includes those who lost their lives in Northern Ireland, for example.    
    
The transcripts are an attempt to provide a structure to the data recorded in the City’s Rolls of Honour. Original copies of the WWI volume can be accessed in the Central Library, Aberdeen Art Gallery, and the Aberdeen City Archives. The WWII and Post-1945 volumes can be viewed in Aberdeen Art Gallery (McBey library on Level 1).

Two years later he formed his own fashion house, **Bill Gibb Ltd**, and launched his first solo collection to critical acclaim. His designs were applauded for their startling combinations of colour, texture and pattern. Collaborating with knitwear designer Kaffe Fassett, he created a signature style of layered knits for women.

By the early 1850s he was established in **Aberdeen** as an **artist and portrait photographer**. He received a contract to photograph the Royal Family, working for Queen Victoria and Prince Albert and was later commissioned to **illustrate Queen Victoria’s diaries** of her time in Scotland when they were published. By the 1860s he was increasingly focussed on landscapes and stereoscopic views.   
   
This dataset is a list of all the items relating to **George Washington Wilson**, his company and successor companies, held by Aberdeen Art Gallery & Museums. We are releasing it as open data to increase public awareness of, and access to, the collection.

This is done through an online reporting system called WasteDataFlow (WDF). Reports are submitted to SEPA annually, with a submission deadline of 28 February.  

Local authority waste data are verified on an annual basis by the Data Unit and are used to help fulfill Scotland’s reporting obligations to the Scottish Government and Europe. The data from WasteDataFlow is used to populate Scotland’s Environment [Household Waste Data Analysis Tool](https://www.environment.gov.scot/data/data-analysis/household-waste/). The tool shows a break-down of household waste generated and managed by waste type for 2011 – 2015 and the trends for household waste generated, recycled and managed since 2004. 

The Scotland’s Environment [Waste Discover Data tool](https://www.environment.gov.scot/data/data-analysis/waste-from-all-sources/) presents waste from all sources, i.e. from households, the construction and demolition sector, and from commerce and industry. The tool shows a break-down of waste types for 2011 – 2015 and the trend for Scottish waste landfilled since 2005.

It will be used to inform development management decisions that involve woodland creation and woodland removal alongside other relevant information.  The Strategy is a land use plan to help identify areas where proposals for woodland creation and management may be supported and activities that will be encouraged through available funding.   The extent to which specific proposals in potential areas will be supported will depend on site specific criteria detailed with in action plans,  individual forest management plans, the Forest Design Framework etc.  The design of schemes will require careful consideration.  (For further detail see http://www.pkc.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=28220&amp;p=0)</span></p><p><span>CLASS:</span></p><p><span>PREFERRED:  Land will be that which offers the greatest scope to accommodate future expansion of a range of woodland types, and hence, to deliver on a very wide range of objectives. Within preferred areas sensitivities are, in general, likely to be limited, and it should be possible to address any particular site specific issues within well designed proposals that meet the UK Forestry Standard and associated guidelines. Most expansion is therefore likely to be focused on preferred areas.</span></p><p><span>POTENTIAL:  Land will be that which offers considerable potential to accommodate future expansion of a range of woodland types, but where at least one significant sensitivity exists. The extent to which specific proposals in potential areas will be supported will depend on how well sensitivities can be addressed within the proposals.

**Outputs from the monitors feed into Stirling Council’s **[**Local Transport Strategy (LTS)**](https://www.stirling.gov.uk/roads-transport-streets/environment-friendly-transport/local-transport-strategy-documents/)**.**

**Cycle and pedestrian data are gathered using cabinets located at the side of footways and cycleways, which detect pedestrians using an infra-red beam, and cyclists using piezoelectric strips.  The devices used are encrypted, and anonymise any data collected, so no pedestrians or cyclists can be traced.**

**The movements which pass through the detection zone of the counters are classified based on which sensors are triggered by the movement.  Where the pedestrian infra-red beam is triggered but not the piezo electric strips, the movement is a pedestrian.  Where both the infra-red beam and the piezo electric strips are triggered, the movement is a cyclist.  The piezo electric strips are installed below the surface of the footway and so when cut, will fail to record anything.**

**In August 2019, the number of locations at which monitors are located increased to 23 with the addition of three sites around Craig’s Roundabout.

View our 2017 based school roll forecasts for Angus’s primary and secondary schools until 2023.
The forecasts take as their starting point the current school population. They then attempt to identify how that population may change over time. In doing so they take into account demographic factors such as birth and migration rates and changes to the school roll arising from new housing. They also build in information about school choices made under the Parents’ Charter. In secondary schools staying-on rates for pupils entering fifth and sixth year are estimated. Finally, numbers are rounded to whole figures, a process which occasionally introduces rounding errors into individual school totals.
The forecasts include a comparison of the current and forecast school roll with the formal capacity of a school.
There is considerable interest in the effect of new house building on school rolls. Projected new house figures used in these forecasts are based on the 2018 Draft Housing Land Audit, supplemented, where appropriate, by site specific intelligence. As ever, it cannot be guaranteed that the exact number of houses specified in the Housing Land Audit will be built or that the build rates will follow precisely the build schedule given.
In general, it is easier to produce accurate forecasts for large schools than for small ones. Any, or all, of the factors mentioned above may vary in the course of a year. The smaller the school the more significant variations will be. The roll of a small primary school can be disproportionately affected, either positively or negatively, by the movement of one or two families. School forecasts, therefore, can, and often do, change from year to year. They remain the best estimate that can be arrived at, using data currently available.
