The Contracts Register is available on [Aberdeen City Council's website](https://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/services/council-and-democracy/financial-information-and-procurement/contracts-register) as a pdf document.  The same details are provided here as open data to increase the accessibility of this information.

Aberdeen City Council tenders are advertised on the [Public Contracts Scotland portal](https://www.publiccontractsscotland.gov.uk/search/Search_MainPageAdv.aspx). You can register on the portal as a supplier and download tender documents from there.

G. Pope.  In early 1925, forms were sent to each householder in Aberdeen asking for full details of those relatives who had fallen during the conflict.  For military personnel, the details included rank, regiment and any military honours.  The forms also requested details of any non-combatants killed by enemy action and those in the **Mercantile Marine** (Merchant Navy - commercial/civilian vessels and crews that were engaged in activity supporting the Nation during times of war or those requisitioned and reassigned to military duties, such as minesweeping). The WWI Roll also drew together many separate lists provided by Churches, the University of Aberdeen, schools, guilds and businesses. The City Assessor was responsible for ensuring that no duplications existed. The final copy of the Roll contained over five thousand names.   
    
Later, two dedicated volumes were created to commemorate lives lost during **World War II**. Volume One: **HM Forces and the Merchant Navy** and Volume Two: **Civil Defence and Civilians**. The separate volumes record slightly different information.    
    
The **Post-1945** Roll varies in intent from the WWI and WWII volumes. This volume is hand-written, and records HM Forces lives lost in conflict and during active service, so includes those who lost their lives in Northern Ireland, for example.

The City Assessor was responsible for ensuring that no duplications existed. The final copy of the Roll contained over five thousand names.   
    
Later, two dedicated volumes were created to commemorate lives lost during **World War II**. Volume One: **HM Forces and the Merchant Navy** and Volume Two: **Civil Defence and Civilians**. The separate volumes record slightly different information.    
    
The **Post-1945** Roll varies in intent from the WWI and WWII volumes. This volume is hand-written, and records HM Forces lives lost in conflict and during active service, so includes those who lost their lives in Northern Ireland, for example.    
    
The transcripts are an attempt to provide a structure to the data recorded in the City’s Rolls of Honour. Original copies of the WWI volume can be accessed in the Central Library, Aberdeen Art Gallery, and the Aberdeen City Archives. The WWII and Post-1945 volumes can be viewed in Aberdeen Art Gallery (McBey library on Level 1).

In 1970, at the start of his career, one of his outfits was selected by Vogue magazine as **Dress of the Year**. Two years later he formed his own fashion house, **Bill Gibb Ltd**, and launched his first solo collection to critical acclaim. His designs were applauded for their startling combinations of colour, texture and pattern. Collaborating with knitwear designer Kaffe Fassett, he created a signature style of layered knits for women. Gibb also gained a reputation for romantic grandeur, dressing celebrities such as model Twiggy and popstars Lulu and Cilla Black. He continued to design for private clients until his death.   
   
In 1997 his archive of sketched designs and swatches was bought by Aberdeen City Council: Museums and Gallery with help from supporters including the **Friends of Aberdeen Art Gallery and Museums**. We continue to add to the collection of outfits and accessories designed by Bill Gibb, and currently hold more than 100 items of clothing, plus numerous other items associated with him.

Marguerite amassed a **substantial archive of books, letters and diaries** charting her life with her husband.

Born in **Foveran** in Aberdeenshire, he worked as a clerk for the North of Scotland Bank. In his spare time, he taught himself etching from a book borrowed from Aberdeen Public Library, producing his first printed works using his grandparents’ mangle. 

Marguerite McBey nee Loeb (1905-1999) met James McBey in America, where she was a practicing photographer and bookbinder. They married in 1931 and lived in America and Morocco. Marguerite amassed a **substantial archive of books, letters and diaries** charting her life with her husband. After his death in 1959 she donated this archive, along with numerous examples of his work, to Aberdeen Art Gallery, making the city’s McBey collection the best in the world.

This is done through an online reporting system called WasteDataFlow (WDF). Reports are submitted to SEPA annually, with a submission deadline of 28 February.  

Local authority waste data are verified on an annual basis by the Data Unit and are used to help fulfill Scotland’s reporting obligations to the Scottish Government and Europe. The data from WasteDataFlow is used to populate Scotland’s Environment [Household Waste Data Analysis Tool](https://www.environment.gov.scot/data/data-analysis/household-waste/). The tool shows a break-down of household waste generated and managed by waste type for 2011 – 2015 and the trends for household waste generated, recycled and managed since 2004. 

The Scotland’s Environment [Waste Discover Data tool](https://www.environment.gov.scot/data/data-analysis/waste-from-all-sources/) presents waste from all sources, i.e. from households, the construction and demolition sector, and from commerce and industry. The tool shows a break-down of waste types for 2011 – 2015 and the trend for Scottish waste landfilled since 2005.

**Journey times’ data are gathered using Bluetooth sensors which detect Bluetooth devices travelling on monitored routes.**  

**The devices that are used are encrypted, and anonymise any data collected. No vehicles can be traced.** 

**Journey times are calculated when one device is identified at two locations, this is referred to as a Bluetooth match.**

**•	There must be a minimum of five Bluetooth matches before the journey time can be generated**
 
**•	Road closures will skew outputs as vehicles will be using alternative routes** 

**•	Sensors can be moved to different sites therefore results will be zero until the locations are updated **

**•	Activity of the sensors can impact results. Normally the Bluetooth sensors are active between 7am and 7pm. However, if they receive up to two weeks of insufficient sunlight there can be unprecedented periods of inactivity**

The designation also aims to promote the highest standards of design to retain the traditional character of these areas. There are 8 Areas of Great Landscape Value (AGLV’s) in Moray.Moray enjoys a high quality landscape and proposals which are likely to result in a significant adverse impact on the landscape will not be supported. The creation of new hill tracks can have a significant impact primarily from the visual appearance of the new track, but also from the drainage and erosion effects on the local area.",arcgis

Boundaries have been drawn around these groupings, and there will be a presumption in favour of developments within this boundary. (The settlement boundary policy E9 (LDP2015) will apply).The concept of identifying and promoting rural development in existing “rural communities” was originally contained in the 1993-98 Plan. At that time they were identified as small rural settlements, which served as social focal points for the surrounding area, with the presence of one or more community facilities (school/hall/shop). In subsequent Plans, the requirement for community facilities has been reduced, and further groupings have been designated based on their status as a cohesive, physical grouping.
