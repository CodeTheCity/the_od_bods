For military personnel, the details included rank, regiment and any military honours.  The forms also requested details of any non-combatants killed by enemy action and those in the **Mercantile Marine** (Merchant Navy - commercial/civilian vessels and crews that were engaged in activity supporting the Nation during times of war or those requisitioned and reassigned to military duties, such as minesweeping).

The City Assessor was responsible for ensuring that no duplications existed. The final copy of the Roll contained over five thousand names.   
    
Later, two dedicated volumes were created to commemorate lives lost during **World War II**. Volume One: **HM Forces and the Merchant Navy** and Volume Two: **Civil Defence and Civilians**. The separate volumes record slightly different information.

Later, two dedicated volumes were created to commemorate lives lost during **World War II**. Volume One: **HM Forces and the Merchant Navy** and Volume Two: **Civil Defence and Civilians**. The separate volumes record slightly different information.    
    
The **Post-1945** Roll varies in intent from the WWI and WWII volumes. This volume is hand-written, and records HM Forces lives lost in conflict and during active service, so includes those who lost their lives in Northern Ireland, for example.    
    
The transcripts are an attempt to provide a structure to the data recorded in the City’s Rolls of Honour. Original copies of the WWI volume can be accessed in the Central Library, Aberdeen Art Gallery, and the Aberdeen City Archives. The WWII and Post-1945 volumes can be viewed in Aberdeen Art Gallery (McBey library on Level 1).

In 1970, at the start of his career, one of his outfits was selected by Vogue magazine as **Dress of the Year**. Two years later he formed his own fashion house, **Bill Gibb Ltd**, and launched his first solo collection to critical acclaim. His designs were applauded for their startling combinations of colour, texture and pattern. Collaborating with knitwear designer Kaffe Fassett, he created a signature style of layered knits for women. Gibb also gained a reputation for romantic grandeur, dressing celebrities such as model Twiggy and popstars Lulu and Cilla Black. He continued to design for private clients until his death.   
   
In 1997 his archive of sketched designs and swatches was bought by Aberdeen City Council: Museums and Gallery with help from supporters including the **Friends of Aberdeen Art Gallery and Museums**.

The aim of listing such buildings is to protect or enhance their special character by affording them statutory protection. The principles for listing buildings are fairly complex and there is no right of appeal against the Scottish Governments decision to list a property. Listed buildings are listed in 3 categories - A, B and C;

* __Category A__ listed buildings are of national or international importance. 
* __Category B__ listed buildings are of regional importance. 
* __Category C__ buildings are of local importance. 

A building's listing covers its interior, exterior and any object or structure fixed to a building or which falls within the curtilage of such a building, forming part of the land since before 1 July 1948.

This is done through an online reporting system called WasteDataFlow (WDF). Reports are submitted to SEPA annually, with a submission deadline of 28 February.  

Local authority waste data are verified on an annual basis by the Data Unit and are used to help fulfill Scotland’s reporting obligations to the Scottish Government and Europe. The data from WasteDataFlow is used to populate Scotland’s Environment [Household Waste Data Analysis Tool](https://www.environment.gov.scot/data/data-analysis/household-waste/). The tool shows a break-down of household waste generated and managed by waste type for 2011 – 2015 and the trends for household waste generated, recycled and managed since 2004. 

The Scotland’s Environment [Waste Discover Data tool](https://www.environment.gov.scot/data/data-analysis/waste-from-all-sources/) presents waste from all sources, i.e. from households, the construction and demolition sector, and from commerce and industry. The tool shows a break-down of waste types for 2011 – 2015 and the trend for Scottish waste landfilled since 2005.

**Outputs from the monitors feed into Stirling Council’s **[**Local Transport Strategy (LTS)**](https://www.stirling.gov.uk/roads-transport-streets/environment-friendly-transport/local-transport-strategy-documents/)**.**

**Cycle and pedestrian data are gathered using cabinets located at the side of footways and cycleways, which detect pedestrians using an infra-red beam, and cyclists using piezoelectric strips.  The devices used are encrypted, and anonymise any data collected, so no pedestrians or cyclists can be traced.**

**The movements which pass through the detection zone of the counters are classified based on which sensors are triggered by the movement.  Where the pedestrian infra-red beam is triggered but not the piezo electric strips, the movement is a pedestrian.  Where both the infra-red beam and the piezo electric strips are triggered, the movement is a cyclist.  The piezo electric strips are installed below the surface of the footway and so when cut, will fail to record anything.**

**In August 2019, the number of locations at which monitors are located increased to 23 with the addition of three sites around Craig’s Roundabout.

**•	Activity of the sensors can impact results. Normally the Bluetooth sensors are active between 7am and 7pm. However, if they receive up to two weeks of insufficient sunlight there can be unprecedented periods of inactivity**

**[Traffic Scotland](https://trafficscotland.org/) can provide updates on any road closures and the [Scottish Roadworks Commissioner](https://www.roadworksscotland.org/) can give further details on any planned roadworks throughout the country.**

View our 2017 based school roll forecasts for Angus’s primary and secondary schools until 2023.
The forecasts take as their starting point the current school population. They then attempt to identify how that population may change over time. In doing so they take into account demographic factors such as birth and migration rates and changes to the school roll arising from new housing. They also build in information about school choices made under the Parents’ Charter. In secondary schools staying-on rates for pupils entering fifth and sixth year are estimated. Finally, numbers are rounded to whole figures, a process which occasionally introduces rounding errors into individual school totals.
The forecasts include a comparison of the current and forecast school roll with the formal capacity of a school.
There is considerable interest in the effect of new house building on school rolls. Projected new house figures used in these forecasts are based on the 2018 Draft Housing Land Audit, supplemented, where appropriate, by site specific intelligence. As ever, it cannot be guaranteed that the exact number of houses specified in the Housing Land Audit will be built or that the build rates will follow precisely the build schedule given.
In general, it is easier to produce accurate forecasts for large schools than for small ones. Any, or all, of the factors mentioned above may vary in the course of a year. The smaller the school the more significant variations will be. The roll of a small primary school can be disproportionately affected, either positively or negatively, by the movement of one or two families. School forecasts, therefore, can, and often do, change from year to year. They remain the best estimate that can be arrived at, using data currently available.

They also have an important role in supporting the mental health capability of the wider network of children's services. CAMHS are usually delivered by multidisciplinary teams including nurses, psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and others.

Delivery of good quality CAMHS depends on adequate numbers of well trained staff being recruited and retained across NHSScotland. Practitioners who contribute to CAMHS include: psychiatric nurses, child and adolescent psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, social workers, psychotherapists (including child/analytical, systemic/family, cognitive behavioural), creative therapists (including art, music and drama), play therapists, liaison teachers, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and dieticians.

Timely access to healthcare is a key measure of quality and that applies equally in respect of access to mental health services. Early action is more likely to result in full recovery and, in the case of children and young people, will also minimise the impact on other aspects of their development such as their education, so improving their wider social development outcomes.

Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new strain of coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China. Clinical presentation may range from mild-to-moderate illness to pneumonia or severe acute respiratory infection. COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation on 12 March 2020. We now have spread of COVID-19 within communities in the UK.

For any individual, the specimen date of their first positive viral PCR result is taken as the date of onset of their first episode of COVID-19.		
Subsequent positive viral PCR results with specimen date within 90 days of their first positive result are discounted.		
If the individual then has a positive viral PCR result with specimen date ≥90 days after their first positive result, this is taken as the date of onset of their second episode of COVID-19.		
Subsequent positive viral PCR results with specimen date within 90 days of this second index date are then discounted as for the first episode of COVID, and so on.		
		
Confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been identified as occurring in pregnancy if the date of onset of the episode of COVID-19 occurred at any point from the estimated date of conception (date the woman was 2+0 weeks gestation) up to and including the date the pregnancy ended. 		
		
Traditionally, pregnancies were dated from the first day of a woman's last menstrual period (LMP) prior to her pregnancy, with this date being set as the first day of gestation (0+0 weeks) and babies being 'due' at 40+0 weeks.		
Conception, and hence the actual start of the pregnancy, usually occurs around 2 weeks after the first day of the LMP, at 2+0 gestation.		
These days, pregnancies are usually dated based on an ultrasound scan done in early pregnancy and the woman's LMP date, but this dating convention is still used, i.e. the date of conception is set at 2+0 weeks gestation.		
		
Broadly the three trimesters of pregnancy divide pregnancies into three approximately equal time periods covering early, mid, and later pregnancy		
However, there is no internationally agreed definition of the exact start and end point of each trimester

https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2017/05/methods-for-estimating-the-due-date		
The most critical period for a baby's development is between 2+0 and 9+6 weeks gestation: this is the period when all the major organs in the body are formed		
		
As the testing data is more up to date than the pregnancy data, we have assumed that any woman showing as 44+0 weeks gestation or over at the date of onset of an episode of COVID-19 was in fact no longer pregnant at that time and this has not been counted as an infection in pregnancy.		
As described in the Data sources tab, these data lag issues will be resolved over time as pregnancy related records are returned to PHS and incorporated into the COPS study database of pregnant women.		
		
The COPS study database includes women aged 11 to 55 years inclusive at the time of conception.  		
		
An unlinked analysis has been used to calculate rates of infection among pregnant women.		
The denominator for this analysis is a 'snapshot' of the number of women pregnant at the start of the specified month.		
The numerator is the number of women with onset of COVID-19 during pregnancy at any point during the specified month.

If the individual then has a positive viral PCR result with specimen date ≥90 days after their first positive result, this is taken as the date of onset of their second episode of COVID-19.		
Subsequent positive viral PCR results with specimen date within 90 days of this second index date are then discounted as for the first episode of COVID, and so on.		
		
Confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been identified as occurring in pregnancy if the date of onset of the episode of COVID-19 occurred at any point from the estimated date of conception (date the woman was 2+0 weeks gestation) up to and including the date the pregnancy ended. 		
		
Traditionally, pregnancies were dated from the first day of a woman's last menstrual period (LMP) prior to her pregnancy, with this date being set as the first day of gestation (0+0 weeks) and babies being 'due' at 40+0 weeks.		
Conception, and hence the actual start of the pregnancy, usually occurs around 2 weeks after the first day of the LMP, at 2+0 gestation.		
These days, pregnancies are usually dated based on an ultrasound scan done in early pregnancy and the woman's LMP date, but this dating convention is still used, i.e. the date of conception is set at 2+0 weeks gestation.		
		
Broadly the three trimesters of pregnancy divide pregnancies into three approximately equal time periods covering early, mid, and later pregnancy		
However, there is no internationally agreed definition of the exact start and end point of each trimester

https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2017/05/methods-for-estimating-the-due-date		
The most critical period for a baby's development is between 2+0 and 9+6 weeks gestation: this is the period when all the major organs in the body are formed		
		
As the testing data is more up to date than the pregnancy data, we have assumed that any woman showing as 44+0 weeks gestation or over at the date of onset of an episode of COVID-19 was in fact no longer pregnant at that time and this has not been counted as an infection in pregnancy.		
As described in the Data sources tab, these data lag issues will be resolved over time as pregnancy related records are returned to PHS and incorporated into the COPS study database of pregnant women.		
		
The COPS study database includes women aged 11 to 55 years inclusive at the time of conception.  		
		
An unlinked analysis has been used to calculate rates of infection among pregnant women.

On 18 November 2021 dose3/booster uptake figures were published by JCVI Priority Groups.  PHS have reviewed the JCVI priority group uptake figures from 18/11/2021, specifically how we derive the numerator and the denominator.  The rational for the change is to ensure we report on most up to date living population for each group.  For this, the list of individuals in each cohort has been refreshed to be more current.  We have also removed individuals who have since died to reflect the current living population.

This means all the JCVI cohorts and populations have changed for both numerator and denominators.  The greatest change is in All Care Home Residents, Frontline Health and Social Care Workers, and Care Home Staff.  These were the 3 indicators that least represented the current population and the method of reporting has now changed to reflect the current living population in each cohort, in line with the other JCVI groups.

On 08 December 2020, a Coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine developed by Pfizer BioNTech (Comirnaty) was first used in the UK as part of national immunisation programmes. The AstraZeneca (Spikevax) vaccine was also approved for use in the national programme, and rollout of this vaccine began on 04 January 2021. Moderna (Vaxzevria) vaccine was approved for use on 8 January 2021 and rollout of this vaccine began on 07 April 2021.

These vaccines have met strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness set out by the independent Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). 

Those giving the vaccine to others were the first to receive the vaccination. In the first phase of the programme, NHS Scotland followed the independent advice received from the [Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI)](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/948353/Priority_groups_for_coronavirus__COVID-19__vaccination_-_advice_from_the_JCVI__2_December_2020.pdf) and prioritised delivery of the vaccine to those with the greatest clinical need, in line with the recommended order of prioritisation.  For booster vaccinations a similar approach has been adopted. 

Definitions used in the vaccine uptake by JCVI priority group resource can be found in the [JCVI Priority Group Definitions table](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/covid-19-vaccination-in-scotland/resource/29e8ab8e-065a-4f92-ab70-4371d757633b). Individuals can appear in more than one JCVI priority group.

A 2-dose primary schedule is advised for the vaccines, followed by a booster dose for those aged 40+ or in certain JCVI priority groups. For the Pfizer BioNTech (Comirnaty) vaccine, the second vaccine dose can be offered between 3 to 12 weeks after the first dose. For the AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria) and Moderna (Spikevax) vaccine, the second dose can be offered 4 to 12 weeks after the first dose.  Booster doses are offered 24 weeks after 2nd dose.  Those are in the severely immuno-suppressed priority group will receive a 3rd primary dose before being eligible for a booster.
This dataset provides information on daily number of COVID vaccinations in Scotland. Data on the total number of vaccinations in Scotland is presented by day administered and vaccine type, by age group, by sex, by non-age cohorts and by geographies (NHS Board and Local Authority). As the population in the cohorts can change with time, these will be refined when updated data are available.

On 18 November 2021 dose3/booster uptake figures were published by JCVI Priority Groups.  PHS have reviewed the JCVI priority group uptake figures from 18/11/2021, specifically how we derive the numerator and the denominator.  The rational for the change is to ensure we report on most up to date living population for each group.  For this, the list of individuals in each cohort has been refreshed to be more current.  We have also removed individuals who have since died to reflect the current living population.

This means all the JCVI cohorts and populations have changed for both numerator and denominators.  The greatest change is in All Care Home Residents, Frontline Health and Social Care Workers, and Care Home Staff.  These were the 3 indicators that least represented the current population and the method of reporting has now changed to reflect the current living population in each cohort, in line with the other JCVI groups.

On 08 December 2020, a Coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine developed by Pfizer BioNTech (Comirnaty) was first used in the UK as part of national immunisation programmes. The AstraZeneca (Spikevax) vaccine was also approved for use in the national programme, and rollout of this vaccine began on 04 January 2021. Moderna (Vaxzevria) vaccine was approved for use on 8 January 2021 and rollout of this vaccine began on 07 April 2021.

These vaccines have met strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness set out by the independent Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). 

Those giving the vaccine to others were the first to receive the vaccination. In the first phase of the programme, NHS Scotland followed the independent advice received from the [Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI)](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/948353/Priority_groups_for_coronavirus__COVID-19__vaccination_-_advice_from_the_JCVI__2_December_2020.pdf) and prioritised delivery of the vaccine to those with the greatest clinical need, in line with the recommended order of prioritisation.  For booster vaccinations a similar approach has been adopted. 

Definitions used in the vaccine uptake by JCVI priority group resource can be found in the [JCVI Priority Group Definitions table](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/covid-19-vaccination-in-scotland/resource/29e8ab8e-065a-4f92-ab70-4371d757633b). Individuals can appear in more than one JCVI priority group.

A 2-dose primary schedule is advised for the vaccines, followed by a booster dose for those aged 40+ or in certain JCVI priority groups. For the Pfizer BioNTech (Comirnaty) vaccine, the second vaccine dose can be offered between 3 to 12 weeks after the first dose. For the AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria) and Moderna (Spikevax) vaccine, the second dose can be offered 4 to 12 weeks after the first dose.  Booster doses are offered 24 weeks after 2nd dose.  Those are in the severely immuno-suppressed priority group will receive a 3rd primary dose before being eligible for a booster.
This dataset provides information on daily number of COVID vaccinations in Scotland. Data on the total number of vaccinations in Scotland is presented by day administered and vaccine type, by age group, by sex, by non-age cohorts and by geographies (NHS Board and Local Authority). As the population in the cohorts can change with time, these will be refined when updated data are available.

In Scotland the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has been used since the start of the vaccination programme on 8 December 2020. The Oxford/Astrazeneca vaccine has been used from 4 January 2021 and the Moderna vaccine from 7 April 2021. 

Women can receive a first or second dose, or both doses, of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy, depending on when they become eligible for vaccination and how this relates to the dates of their pregnancy.

PHS has generated this information on COVID-19 vaccinations delivered to pregnant women by linking national data on vaccinations to the COVID-19 in Pregnancy in Scotland (COPS) study database of pregnant women in Scotland.

As part of the COPS study, PHS is regularly linking together a wide range of health records to identify women who are, or recently have been, pregnant.  The specific records used include:

- Records of booking for antenatal care
- GP records relating to miscarriage
- Hospital discharge records relating to miscarriage or delivery of a live or stillborn baby
- Statutory termination of pregnancy notification records
- Statutory live or stillbirth registration records
- NHS live birth notification records.

Using these records, we have identified all women in Scotland who were pregnant on 1 March 2020 (the start of the COVID-19 pandemic), and all women who have subsequently become pregnant.  

The study database is refreshed every month with new pregnancies added to the database, and previous records of ongoing pregnancies updated as required, for example if a woman has recently delivered her baby.

Further details on the COPS study are available on the [Usher Institute webpage](https://www.ed.ac.uk/usher/research/projects/covid-19-pregnancy-scotland) and [PHS github page](https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/COPS-public).

However, how some elements of maternity care are delivered has changed in order to minimise the number of visits women need to make. The ‘booking’ appointment is the first main appointment a woman has with her local maternity service once she knows she is pregnant. At the booking appointment, women are assessed by a midwife who can then tailor the subsequent care they receive during their pregnancy to their particular preferences and needs. Women are encouraged to book before they are 13 weeks pregnant, and ideally before they are 10 weeks pregnant. 

In general, prior to COVID-19, women were offered an initial in-person booking appointment (including various face to face tests such as blood tests and blood pressure monitoring) then a follow up appointment for their early pregnancy ultrasound scan. Since March 2020, in many areas women have been offered an initial remote consultation, then an in-person ‘one stop’ follow up appointment for all their face to face tests and their scan.

This dataset shows the number of women booking for antenatal care in each week from the week beginning 1 April 2019 onwards. In addition to the weekly data, monthly data (based on exact month of booking rather than summation of sequential weeks) is presented for each NHS Board of residence, including the Island Boards. Due to small numbers, weekly data is not shown for individual Island Boards of residence (NHS Orkney, NHS Shetland, and NHS Western Isles), however the Island Boards are included in the Scotland total.

• Individuals being reluctant to use health services because they do not want to burden the NHS or are anxious about the risk of infection.

• The health service delaying preventative and non-urgent care such as some screening services and planned surgery.

• Other indirect effects of interventions to control COVID-19, such as mental or physical consequences of distancing measures.

The COVID-19 pandemic has wider impacts on individuals’ health, and their use of healthcare services, than those that occur as the direct result of infection.
Reasons for this may include:

• Individuals being reluctant to use health services because they do not want to burden the NHS or are anxious about the risk of infection.

• The health service delaying preventative and non-urgent care such as some screening services and planned surgery.

• Other indirect effects of interventions to control COVID-19, such as mental or physical consequences of distancing measures.

As such, it has been provided throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, and maternity and neonatal staff have not been redeployed to support other services. The way that some elements of this care are provided has changed in response to COVID-19 however, to minimise the risk of infection and to allow services to continue to provide safe care during times when a high number of staff may be off work, for example due to needing to isolate. Relevant guidance has been issued by the Scottish Government, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, and the British Association for Perinatal Medicine.

‘Gestation at delivery’ refers to the number of completed weeks pregnant a woman is when she delivers her baby. Babies are ‘due’ at 40 completed weeks gestation. Those born between 37 and 41 weeks inclusive are considered to be born ‘at term’. Babies born at under 37 weeks (more than three weeks before their due date) are considered preterm or premature, with those born at under 32 weeks considered very preterm and those born at 32 to 36 weeks inclusive considered moderately preterm. Babies born at or over 42 weeks (more than two weeks after their due date) are considered post-term or over-due. Babies born preterm are at increased risk of both short and long term health and developmental problems, with the risk increasing the earlier a baby is born. Babies are also at increased risk when pregnancies extend post-term, in particular the risk of stillbirth increases from 42 weeks gestation onwards.

This dataset presents information on gestation at delivery. Data is shown at Scotland and NHS Board level, as well as broken down by age group and deprivation.

As such, it has been provided throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, and maternity and neonatal staff have not been redeployed to support other services. The way that some elements of this care are provided has changed in response to COVID-19 however, to minimise the risk of infection and to allow services to continue to provide safe care during times when a high number of staff may be off work, for example due to needing to isolate. Relevant guidance has been issued by the Scottish Government, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, and the British Association for Perinatal Medicine.

‘Gestation at delivery’ refers to the number of completed weeks pregnant a woman is when she delivers her baby. Babies are ‘due’ at 40 completed weeks gestation. Those born between 37 and 41 weeks inclusive are considered to be born ‘at term’. Babies born at under 37 weeks (more than three weeks before their due date) are considered preterm or premature, with those born at under 32 weeks considered very preterm and those born at 32 to 36 weeks inclusive considered moderately preterm. Babies born at or over 42 weeks (more than two weeks after their due date) are considered post-term or over-due. Babies born preterm are at increased risk of both short and long term health and developmental problems, with the risk increasing the earlier a baby is born. Babies are also at increased risk when pregnancies extend post-term, in particular the risk of stillbirth increases from 42 weeks gestation onwards.

This dataset presents information on gestation at delivery. Data is shown at Scotland and NHS Board level, as well as broken down by age group and deprivation.

The way that some elements of this care are provided has changed in response to COVID-19 however, to minimise the risk of infection and to allow services to continue to provide safe care during times when a high number of staff may be off work, for example due to needing to isolate.

Guidance issued by the Scottish Government and Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists to maternity services at the height of the first wave of the pandemic noted that:

•	It may be necessary for services to temporarily suspend the option for women to deliver at home or in midwife led units, and to concentrate delivery care within obstetric units

•	Additional restrictions on the use of water births were recommended

•	Care pathways for women requiring induction of labour should be amended to ensure the early stages of the induction process were delivered on an outpatient basis wherever possible

•	Services should consider deferring a planned induction of labour or elective caesarean section if a woman was isolating due to having COVID-19, or having been in contact with a case, if it was safe to do so

•	Services should support low risk women in the early latent phase of labour to remain at home wherever possible

•	In general, strict restrictions on visitors for patients in hospital were advised, however women giving birth could still be accompanied by their chosen birth partner

'Induction of labour' is when a woman is given a medical intervention to start her labour rather than waiting for labour to start spontaneously. It is offered because there are medical reasons meaning it is considered safer (for the mother or baby) for the baby to be born, or because a woman is past her ‘due date’. There are different approaches to inducing labour, for example using medicines, a medical ‘balloon’ device that sits at the neck of the womb, and/or breaking the woman’s waters.

This dataset shows information on induction of labour, presented at Scotland and NHS Board level. Scotland level data is also available by age group and deprivation category. The information on induction of labour presented in this dataset is taken from hospital discharge records, specifically records relating to the care of women delivering a singleton live birth (i.e. one baby, not twins or more) at 37-42 weeks gestation (i.e. up to 3 weeks before or after their due date).

As such, it has been provided throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, and maternity staff have not been redeployed to support other services. The way that some elements of this care are provided has changed in response to COVID-19 however, to minimise the risk of infection and to allow services to continue to provide safe care during times when a high number of staff may be off work, for example due to needing to isolate.

Guidance issued by the Scottish Government and Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists to maternity services at the height of the first wave of the pandemic noted that:

•	It may be necessary for services to temporarily suspend the option for women to deliver at home or in midwife led units, and to concentrate delivery care within obstetric units

•	Additional restrictions on the use of water births were recommended

•	Care pathways for women requiring induction of labour should be amended to ensure the early stages of the induction process were delivered on an outpatient basis wherever possible

•	Services should consider deferring a planned induction of labour or elective caesarean section if a woman was isolating due to having COVID-19, or having been in contact with a case, if it was safe to do so

•	Services should support low risk women in the early latent phase of labour to remain at home wherever possible

•	In general, strict restrictions on visitors for patients in hospital were advised, however women giving birth could still be accompanied by their chosen birth partner

'Induction of labour' is when a woman is given a medical intervention to start her labour rather than waiting for labour to start spontaneously. It is offered because there are medical reasons meaning it is considered safer (for the mother or baby) for the baby to be born, or because a woman is past her ‘due date’. There are different approaches to inducing labour, for example using medicines, a medical ‘balloon’ device that sits at the neck of the womb, and/or breaking the woman’s waters.

This dataset shows information on induction of labour, presented at Scotland and NHS Board level. Scotland level data is also available by age group and deprivation category. The information on induction of labour presented in this dataset is taken from hospital discharge records, specifically records relating to the care of women delivering a singleton live birth (i.e. one baby, not twins or more) at 37-42 weeks gestation (i.e. up to 3 weeks before or after their due date).

The ‘method of delivery' refers to the way a baby is born. Different methods of delivery include spontaneous vaginal delivery (a natural birth); assisted vaginal delivery (including vaginal delivery by forceps or ventouse, or vaginal delivery of a breech baby); or a caesarean section (an operation to deliver the baby through a cut in the mother’s abdomen). A caesarean section can be elective (planned in advance and provided before labour has started) or emergency (unplanned, and usually but not always provided after labour has started).

The COVID-19 pandemic has wider impacts on individuals’ health, and their use of healthcare services, than those that occur as the direct result of infection.
Reasons for this may include:

• Individuals being reluctant to use health services because they do not want to burden the NHS or are anxious about the risk of infection.

• The health service delaying preventative and non-urgent care such as some screening services and planned surgery.

• Other indirect effects of interventions to control COVID-19, such as mental or physical consequences of distancing measures.

Clinical presentation may range from mild-to-moderate illness to pneumonia or severe acute respiratory infection. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has wider impacts on individuals’ health, and their use of healthcare services, than those that occur as the direct result of infection.
Reasons for this may include:

• Individuals being reluctant to use health services because they do not want to burden the NHS or are anxious about the risk of infection.

• The health service delaying preventative and non-urgent care such as some screening services and planned surgery.

• Other indirect effects of interventions to control COVID-19, such as mental or physical consequences of distancing measures.

This dataset provides information on trend data regarding the wider impact of the pandemic on Scottish Ambulance Services. Data are shown by age group, sex and broad deprivation category (SIMD), as well as by different levels of geographical breakdown such as Health Boards, Health and Social Care partnerships, and Scotland totals. 

Please note that the source of this data is the Unscheduled Care Datamart and represents a sub-set of the total Scottish Ambulance service activity. Figures include emergencies, where a vehicle arrived at the scene of the incident, and excludes both data from resources which were cleared as ‘dealt with by another vehicle’ and air ambulance data. The figures presented in this dataset relate to incidents concerning both COVID-19 and non-COVID issues.

Termination of pregnancy can be carried out as a medical procedure or, less commonly, a surgical procedure. Medical terminations involve the woman taking two different medicines 24-48 hours apart to end her pregnancy. Prior to October 2017, women having a medical termination were required to attend a clinic or hospital on two occasions to take the first and then, separately, the second medicine. From October 2017, women requiring an early medical termination (at up to 9 weeks and 6 days gestation) were able to take the second medicine away with them at the end of their first appointment, and subsequently take that at home. From 31 March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, women requiring an early medical termination (at up to 11 weeks and 6 days gestation) have been able to have an initial remote consultation, by telephone or video call, then take both medicines at home.

Termination of pregnancy (also referred to as a therapeutic or induced abortion) is provided under the terms of the Abortion Act 1967 and subsequent regulations. When a healthcare practitioner provides a termination of pregnancy, there is a legal requirement for them to notify the Chief Medical Officer of the termination within seven days of it taking place. Public Health Scotland is responsible for the collation of data derived from notifications of terminations of pregnancy on behalf of the Chief Medical Officer. Detailed information on terminations is published each year by Public Health Scotland. The most recent report covers the year to December 2019.

This dataset presents information on the number of terminations of pregnancy carried out in Scotland, and the average gestation (stage of pregnancy) at which they occurred. Data is shown at Scotland and NHS Board level, as well as broken down by age group and deprivation.

On 1st December 2020 NHS Ayrshire & Arran, NHS Dumfries & Galloway, NHS Grampian, and NHS Western Isles began using the Drug and Alcohol Information System (DAISy), a new national database for Scotland. It is expected that the remaining NHS Boards will transfer to DAISy in April 2021. DAISy holds data in relation to drug and alcohol treatments and waiting times from services throughout Scotland delivering tier 3 and 4 interventions. DAISy replaces the previous systems:

•	Drug & Alcohol Treatment Waiting Times (DATWT)

•	Scottish Drug Misuse Database (SDMD)

In order to allow sufficient time for quality assurance work to be undertaken, data for referrals received during December 2020 for the above 4 NHS Boards has not been included in this data.

The Covid-19 pandemic has had a detrimental impact on coverage of P1 reviews in 2019/20 as many of these had not been carried out prior to the closure of schools in March. Analysis of reviews for 2019/20 has shown that the Scotland level data is broadly representative of a ‘normal’ school year, nonetheless the low coverage means that Scotland level results shown should be treated with a degree of caution. Analysis of BMI distribution is shown for individual NHS Boards and local authorities where the coverage exceeds 50%, but is not shown for the areas with low coverage.

The Covid-19 pandemic has had a detrimental impact on coverage of P1 reviews in 2019/20 as many of these had not been carried out prior to the closure of schools in March. Analysis of reviews for 2019/20 has shown that the Scotland level data is broadly representative of a ‘normal’ school year, nonetheless the low coverage means that Scotland level results shown should be treated with a degree of caution. Analysis of BMI distribution is shown for individual NHS Boards and local authorities where the coverage exceeds 50%, but is not shown for the areas with low coverage.
