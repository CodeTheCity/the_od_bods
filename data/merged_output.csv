G. Pope.  In early 1925, forms were sent to each householder in Aberdeen asking for full details of those relatives who had fallen during the conflict.  For military personnel, the details included rank, regiment and any military honours.  The forms also requested details of any non-combatants killed by enemy action and those in the **Mercantile Marine** (Merchant Navy - commercial/civilian vessels and crews that were engaged in activity supporting the Nation during times of war or those requisitioned and reassigned to military duties, such as minesweeping). The WWI Roll also drew together many separate lists provided by Churches, the University of Aberdeen, schools, guilds and businesses. The City Assessor was responsible for ensuring that no duplications existed. The final copy of the Roll contained over five thousand names.   
    
Later, two dedicated volumes were created to commemorate lives lost during **World War II**. Volume One: **HM Forces and the Merchant Navy** and Volume Two: **Civil Defence and Civilians**. The separate volumes record slightly different information.    
    
The **Post-1945** Roll varies in intent from the WWI and WWII volumes. This volume is hand-written, and records HM Forces lives lost in conflict and during active service, so includes those who lost their lives in Northern Ireland, for example.

G. Pope.  In early 1925, forms were sent to each householder in Aberdeen asking for full details of those relatives who had fallen during the conflict.  For military personnel, the details included rank, regiment and any military honours.  The forms also requested details of any non-combatants killed by enemy action and those in the **Mercantile Marine** (Merchant Navy - commercial/civilian vessels and crews that were engaged in activity supporting the Nation during times of war or those requisitioned and reassigned to military duties, such as minesweeping). The WWI Roll also drew together many separate lists provided by Churches, the University of Aberdeen, schools, guilds and businesses. The City Assessor was responsible for ensuring that no duplications existed. The final copy of the Roll contained over five thousand names.   
    
Later, two dedicated volumes were created to commemorate lives lost during **World War II**. Volume One: **HM Forces and the Merchant Navy** and Volume Two: **Civil Defence and Civilians**. The separate volumes record slightly different information.    
    
The **Post-1945** Roll varies in intent from the WWI and WWII volumes. This volume is hand-written, and records HM Forces lives lost in conflict and during active service, so includes those who lost their lives in Northern Ireland, for example.    
    
The transcripts are an attempt to provide a structure to the data recorded in the City’s Rolls of Honour. Original copies of the WWI volume can be accessed in the Central Library, Aberdeen Art Gallery, and the Aberdeen City Archives. The WWII and Post-1945 volumes can be viewed in Aberdeen Art Gallery (McBey library on Level 1).

Two years later he formed his own fashion house, **Bill Gibb Ltd**, and launched his first solo collection to critical acclaim. His designs were applauded for their startling combinations of colour, texture and pattern. Collaborating with knitwear designer Kaffe Fassett, he created a signature style of layered knits for women.

The data from WasteDataFlow is used to populate Scotland’s Environment [Household Waste Data Analysis Tool](https://www.environment.gov.scot/data/data-analysis/household-waste/). The tool shows a break-down of household waste generated and managed by waste type for 2011 – 2015 and the trends for household waste generated, recycled and managed since 2004. 

The Scotland’s Environment [Waste Discover Data tool](https://www.environment.gov.scot/data/data-analysis/waste-from-all-sources/) presents waste from all sources, i.e. from households, the construction and demolition sector, and from commerce and industry. The tool shows a break-down of waste types for 2011 – 2015 and the trend for Scottish waste landfilled since 2005.

All data can be exported to Excel if required.",ckan API,,;waste,Environment

It will be used to inform development management decisions that involve woodland creation and woodland removal alongside other relevant information.  The Strategy is a land use plan to help identify areas where proposals for woodland creation and management may be supported and activities that will be encouraged through available funding.

The content of the Product is divided into themes based on their type and local type classification values. The primary use of the product is to provide the location for a named place to support discovery or identification and visualisation, geocoding, routing and navigation and linking diverse information about a place (for example, statistics or descriptions). The name of the place will be the key property used for querying. It is also recognised that a place may have multiple names; an official name, which may be defined in multiple languages (English/Welsh or English/Gaelic), for example, Cardiff (English) and Caerdydd (Welsh). Names are not unique so additional location information is provided to enable users to refine their query to select the Named Place they are interested in.

View our 2017 based school roll forecasts for Angus’s primary and secondary schools until 2023.
The forecasts take as their starting point the current school population. They then attempt to identify how that population may change over time. In doing so they take into account demographic factors such as birth and migration rates and changes to the school roll arising from new housing. They also build in information about school choices made under the Parents’ Charter. In secondary schools staying-on rates for pupils entering fifth and sixth year are estimated. Finally, numbers are rounded to whole figures, a process which occasionally introduces rounding errors into individual school totals.
The forecasts include a comparison of the current and forecast school roll with the formal capacity of a school.
There is considerable interest in the effect of new house building on school rolls. Projected new house figures used in these forecasts are based on the 2018 Draft Housing Land Audit, supplemented, where appropriate, by site specific intelligence. As ever, it cannot be guaranteed that the exact number of houses specified in the Housing Land Audit will be built or that the build rates will follow precisely the build schedule given.
In general, it is easier to produce accurate forecasts for large schools than for small ones. Any, or all, of the factors mentioned above may vary in the course of a year. The smaller the school the more significant variations will be. The roll of a small primary school can be disproportionately affected, either positively or negatively, by the movement of one or two families. School forecasts, therefore, can, and often do, change from year to year. They remain the best estimate that can be arrived at, using data currently available.

They also have an important role in supporting the mental health capability of the wider network of children's services. CAMHS are usually delivered by multidisciplinary teams including nurses, psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and others.

Delivery of good quality CAMHS depends on adequate numbers of well trained staff being recruited and retained across NHSScotland. Practitioners who contribute to CAMHS include: psychiatric nurses, child and adolescent psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, social workers, psychotherapists (including child/analytical, systemic/family, cognitive behavioural), creative therapists (including art, music and drama), play therapists, liaison teachers, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and dieticians.

Timely access to healthcare is a key measure of quality and that applies equally in respect of access to mental health services. Early action is more likely to result in full recovery and, in the case of children and young people, will also minimise the impact on other aspects of their development such as their education, so improving their wider social development outcomes.

This is unfortunately due to a reoccurrence of the server issue from earlier in the week, meaning data has not been processed since 2pm on 16th March.**

In the process of updating the hospital admissions reporting to include reinfections, we have had to review existing methodology. In order to provide the best possible linkage of COVID-19 cases to hospital admissions, each admission record is required to have a discharge date, to allow us to better match the most appropriate COVID positive episode details to an admission. This means that in cases where the discharge date is missing (either due to the patient still being treated, delays in discharge information being submitted or data quality issues), it has to be estimated.  Estimating a discharge date for historic records means that the average stay for those with missing dates is reduced, and fewer stays overlap with records of positive tests. 

The result of these changes has meant that approximately 1,200 historic COVID admissions have been removed due to improvements in methodology to handle missing discharge dates, while approximately 820 have been added to the cumulative total with the inclusion of reinfections. 

COVID-19 hospital admissions are now identified as the following: A patient's first positive PCR or LFD test of the episode of infection (including reinfections at 90 days or more) for COVID-19 up to 14 days prior to admission to hospital, on the day of their admission or during their stay in hospital. If a patient's first positive PCR or LFD test of the episode of infection is after their date of discharge from hospital, they are not included in the analysis.

In order to provide the best possible linkage of COVID-19 cases to hospital admissions, each admission record is required to have a discharge date, to allow us to better match the most appropriate COVID positive episode details to an admission. This means that in cases where the discharge date is missing (either due to the patient still being treated, delays in discharge information being submitted or data quality issues), it has to be estimated.  Estimating a discharge date for historic records means that the average stay for those with missing dates is reduced, and fewer stays overlap with records of positive tests. 

The result of these changes has meant that approximately 1,200 historic COVID admissions have been removed due to improvements in methodology to handle missing discharge dates, while approximately 820 have been added to the cumulative total with the inclusion of reinfections. 

COVID-19 hospital admissions are now identified as the following: A patient's first positive PCR or LFD test of the episode of infection (including reinfections at 90 days or more) for COVID-19 up to 14 days prior to admission to hospital, on the day of their admission or during their stay in hospital. If a patient's first positive PCR or LFD test of the episode of infection is after their date of discharge from hospital, they are not included in the analysis.

In the process of updating the hospital admissions reporting to include reinfections, we have had to review existing methodology. In order to provide the best possible linkage of COVID-19 cases to hospital admissions, each admission record is required to have a discharge date, to allow us to better match the most appropriate COVID positive episode details to an admission. This means that in cases where the discharge date is missing (either due to the patient still being treated, delays in discharge information being submitted or data quality issues), it has to be estimated.  Estimating a discharge date for historic records means that the average stay for those with missing dates is reduced, and fewer stays overlap with records of positive tests. 

The result of these changes has meant that approximately 1,200 historic COVID admissions have been removed due to improvements in methodology to handle missing discharge dates, while approximately 820 have been added to the cumulative total with the inclusion of reinfections. 

COVID-19 hospital admissions are now identified as the following: A patient's first positive PCR or LFD test of the episode of infection (including reinfections at 90 days or more) for COVID-19 up to 14 days prior to admission to hospital, on the day of their admission or during their stay in hospital. If a patient's first positive PCR or LFD test of the episode of infection is after their date of discharge from hospital, they are not included in the analysis.

For any individual, the specimen date of their first positive viral PCR result is taken as the date of onset of their first episode of COVID-19.		
Subsequent positive viral PCR results with specimen date within 90 days of their first positive result are discounted.		
If the individual then has a positive viral PCR result with specimen date ≥90 days after their first positive result, this is taken as the date of onset of their second episode of COVID-19.		
Subsequent positive viral PCR results with specimen date within 90 days of this second index date are then discounted as for the first episode of COVID, and so on.		
		
Confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been identified as occurring in pregnancy if the date of onset of the episode of COVID-19 occurred at any point from the estimated date of conception (date the woman was 2+0 weeks gestation) up to and including the date the pregnancy ended. 		
		
Traditionally, pregnancies were dated from the first day of a woman's last menstrual period (LMP) prior to her pregnancy, with this date being set as the first day of gestation (0+0 weeks) and babies being 'due' at 40+0 weeks.		
Conception, and hence the actual start of the pregnancy, usually occurs around 2 weeks after the first day of the LMP, at 2+0 gestation.		
These days, pregnancies are usually dated based on an ultrasound scan done in early pregnancy and the woman's LMP date, but this dating convention is still used, i.e. the date of conception is set at 2+0 weeks gestation.		
		
Broadly the three trimesters of pregnancy divide pregnancies into three approximately equal time periods covering early, mid, and later pregnancy		
However, there is no internationally agreed definition of the exact start and end point of each trimester		
Here we have used the definitions recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists		
https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2017/05/methods-for-estimating-the-due-date		
The most critical period for a baby's development is between 2+0 and 9+6 weeks gestation: this is the period when all the major organs in the body are formed		
		
As the testing data is more up to date than the pregnancy data, we have assumed that any woman showing as 44+0 weeks gestation or over at the date of onset of an episode of COVID-19 was in fact no longer pregnant at that time and this has not been counted as an infection in pregnancy.		
As described in the Data sources tab, these data lag issues will be resolved over time as pregnancy related records are returned to PHS and incorporated into the COPS study database of pregnant women.		
		
The COPS study database includes women aged 11 to 55 years inclusive at the time of conception.  		
		
An unlinked analysis has been used to calculate rates of infection among pregnant women.		
The denominator for this analysis is a 'snapshot' of the number of women pregnant at the start of the specified month.		
The numerator is the number of women with onset of COVID-19 during pregnancy at any point during the specified month.

Subsequent positive viral PCR results with specimen date within 90 days of this second index date are then discounted as for the first episode of COVID, and so on.		
		
Confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been identified as occurring in pregnancy if the date of onset of the episode of COVID-19 occurred at any point from the estimated date of conception (date the woman was 2+0 weeks gestation) up to and including the date the pregnancy ended. 		
		
Traditionally, pregnancies were dated from the first day of a woman's last menstrual period (LMP) prior to her pregnancy, with this date being set as the first day of gestation (0+0 weeks) and babies being 'due' at 40+0 weeks.		
Conception, and hence the actual start of the pregnancy, usually occurs around 2 weeks after the first day of the LMP, at 2+0 gestation.		
These days, pregnancies are usually dated based on an ultrasound scan done in early pregnancy and the woman's LMP date, but this dating convention is still used, i.e. the date of conception is set at 2+0 weeks gestation.		
		
Broadly the three trimesters of pregnancy divide pregnancies into three approximately equal time periods covering early, mid, and later pregnancy		
However, there is no internationally agreed definition of the exact start and end point of each trimester		
Here we have used the definitions recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists		
https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2017/05/methods-for-estimating-the-due-date		
The most critical period for a baby's development is between 2+0 and 9+6 weeks gestation: this is the period when all the major organs in the body are formed		
		
As the testing data is more up to date than the pregnancy data, we have assumed that any woman showing as 44+0 weeks gestation or over at the date of onset of an episode of COVID-19 was in fact no longer pregnant at that time and this has not been counted as an infection in pregnancy.		
As described in the Data sources tab, these data lag issues will be resolved over time as pregnancy related records are returned to PHS and incorporated into the COPS study database of pregnant women.		
		
The COPS study database includes women aged 11 to 55 years inclusive at the time of conception.  		
		
An unlinked analysis has been used to calculate rates of infection among pregnant women.		
The denominator for this analysis is a 'snapshot' of the number of women pregnant at the start of the specified month.		
The numerator is the number of women with onset of COVID-19 during pregnancy at any point during the specified month.

Vaccine uptake statistics among care home residents and those who are severely immunosuppressed will be reported initially. PHS will include further updates as the Spring/Summer vaccination programme rolls out._

_In addition, as part of our continuous review of reporting, PHS made some changes to vaccine uptake statistics. From 24 March 2022, the deceased and those who no longer live in Scotland are no longer be included in vaccine uptake statistics.  Historic trend data have been updated to take into account this new methodology for all apart from the Daily Trends by JCVI Priority Group table (more details about the data in this table are below).  Scotland level data for all vaccinations administered (i.e. including those who have since died or moved from Scotland) are still available in the Daily Trend of All Vaccinations Delivered in Scotland table._

During this window, the datasets will not be visible and any queries made to these datasets will return a 404 – Not found error. At all other times the datasets will be available in full as usual.**

PHS reviewed the JCVI priority group uptake figures from 18 November 2021, specifically how we derive the numerator and the denominator.  The rational for the change is to ensure we report on most up to date living population for each group.  For this, the list of individuals in each cohort has been refreshed to be more current.  We have also removed individuals who have since died to reflect the current living population. From the 24 March 2022 those who are no longer living in Scotland have also been removed from the numerator and denominator for JCVI priority group uptake figures.

This means all the JCVI cohorts and populations have changed for both numerator and denominators on these two dates and care should be taken when interpreting trends.

On 08 December 2020, a Coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine developed by Pfizer BioNTech (Comirnaty) was first used in the UK as part of national immunisation programmes. The AstraZeneca (Spikevax) vaccine was also approved for use in the national programme, and rollout of this vaccine began on 04 January 2021. Moderna (Vaxzevria) vaccine was approved for use on 8 January 2021 and rollout of this vaccine began on 07 April 2021.

These vaccines have met strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness set out by the independent Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). 

Those giving the vaccine to others were the first to receive the vaccination. In the first phase of the programme, NHS Scotland followed the independent advice received from the [Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI)](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/948353/Priority_groups_for_coronavirus__COVID-19__vaccination_-_advice_from_the_JCVI__2_December_2020.pdf) and prioritised delivery of the vaccine to those with the greatest clinical need, in line with the recommended order of prioritisation.  For booster vaccinations a similar approach has been adopted. 

Definitions used in the vaccine uptake by JCVI priority group resource can be found in the [JCVI Priority Group Definitions table](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/covid-19-vaccination-in-scotland/resource/29e8ab8e-065a-4f92-ab70-4371d757633b). Individuals can appear in more than one JCVI priority group.

A 2-dose primary schedule is advised for the vaccines - followed by a booster dose and a secondary booster for those aged 75+ or in certain JCVI priority groups. For the Pfizer BioNTech (Comirnaty) vaccine, the second vaccine dose can be offered between 3 to 12 weeks after the first dose. For the AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria) and Moderna (Spikevax) vaccine, the second dose can be offered 4 to 12 weeks after the first dose.  First booster doses are offered 12 weeks after 2nd dose. Second boosters are offered 24 weeks after the initial booster. Those are in the severely immuno-suppressed priority group will receive a 3rd primary dose before being eligible for a first booster.

This dataset provides information on daily number of COVID vaccinations in Scotland. Data on the total number of vaccinations in Scotland is presented by day administered and vaccine type, by age group, by sex, by non-age cohorts and by geographies (NHS Board and Local Authority). As the population in the cohorts can change with time, these will be refined when updated data are available.

On 08 December 2020, a Coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine developed by Pfizer BioNTech (Comirnaty) was first used in the UK as part of national immunisation programmes. The AstraZeneca (Spikevax) vaccine was also approved for use in the national programme, and rollout of this vaccine began on 04 January 2021. Moderna (Vaxzevria) vaccine was approved for use on 8 January 2021 and rollout of this vaccine began on 07 April 2021.

These vaccines have met strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness set out by the independent Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). 

Those giving the vaccine to others were the first to receive the vaccination. In the first phase of the programme, NHS Scotland followed the independent advice received from the [Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI)](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/948353/Priority_groups_for_coronavirus__COVID-19__vaccination_-_advice_from_the_JCVI__2_December_2020.pdf) and prioritised delivery of the vaccine to those with the greatest clinical need, in line with the recommended order of prioritisation.  For booster vaccinations a similar approach has been adopted. 

Definitions used in the vaccine uptake by JCVI priority group resource can be found in the [JCVI Priority Group Definitions table](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/covid-19-vaccination-in-scotland/resource/29e8ab8e-065a-4f92-ab70-4371d757633b). Individuals can appear in more than one JCVI priority group.

A 2-dose primary schedule is advised for the vaccines - followed by a booster dose and a secondary booster for those aged 75+ or in certain JCVI priority groups. For the Pfizer BioNTech (Comirnaty) vaccine, the second vaccine dose can be offered between 3 to 12 weeks after the first dose. For the AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria) and Moderna (Spikevax) vaccine, the second dose can be offered 4 to 12 weeks after the first dose.  First booster doses are offered 12 weeks after 2nd dose. Second boosters are offered 24 weeks after the initial booster. Those are in the severely immuno-suppressed priority group will receive a 3rd primary dose before being eligible for a first booster.

This dataset provides information on daily number of COVID vaccinations in Scotland. Data on the total number of vaccinations in Scotland is presented by day administered and vaccine type, by age group, by sex, by non-age cohorts and by geographies (NHS Board and Local Authority). As the population in the cohorts can change with time, these will be refined when updated data are available.

Individuals can appear in more than one JCVI priority group.

A 2-dose primary schedule is advised for the vaccines - followed by a booster dose and a secondary booster for those aged 75+ or in certain JCVI priority groups. For the Pfizer BioNTech (Comirnaty) vaccine, the second vaccine dose can be offered between 3 to 12 weeks after the first dose. For the AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria) and Moderna (Spikevax) vaccine, the second dose can be offered 4 to 12 weeks after the first dose.  First booster doses are offered 12 weeks after 2nd dose. Second boosters are offered 24 weeks after the initial booster. Those are in the severely immuno-suppressed priority group will receive a 3rd primary dose before being eligible for a first booster.

This dataset provides information on daily number of COVID vaccinations in Scotland. Data on the total number of vaccinations in Scotland is presented by day administered and vaccine type, by age group, by sex, by non-age cohorts and by geographies (NHS Board and Local Authority). As the population in the cohorts can change with time, these will be refined when updated data are available.

PHS reviewed the JCVI priority group uptake figures from 18 November 2021, specifically how we derive the numerator and the denominator.  The rational for the change is to ensure we report on most up to date living population for each group.  For this, the list of individuals in each cohort has been refreshed to be more current.  We have also removed individuals who have since died to reflect the current living population. From the 24 March 2022 those who are no longer living in Scotland have also been removed from the numerator and denominator for JCVI priority group uptake figures.

This means all the JCVI cohorts and populations have changed for both numerator and denominators on these two dates and care should be taken when interpreting trends.

In Scotland the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has been used since the start of the vaccination programme on 8 December 2020. The Oxford/Astrazeneca vaccine has been used from 4 January 2021 and the Moderna vaccine from 7 April 2021. 

Women can receive a first or second dose, or both doses, of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy, depending on when they become eligible for vaccination and how this relates to the dates of their pregnancy.

PHS has generated this information on COVID-19 vaccinations delivered to pregnant women by linking national data on vaccinations to the COVID-19 in Pregnancy in Scotland (COPS) study database of pregnant women in Scotland.

As part of the COPS study, PHS is regularly linking together a wide range of health records to identify women who are, or recently have been, pregnant.  The specific records used include:

- Records of booking for antenatal care
- GP records relating to miscarriage
- Hospital discharge records relating to miscarriage or delivery of a live or stillborn baby
- Statutory termination of pregnancy notification records
- Statutory live or stillbirth registration records
- NHS live birth notification records.

Using these records, we have identified all women in Scotland who were pregnant on 1 March 2020 (the start of the COVID-19 pandemic), and all women who have subsequently become pregnant.  

The study database is refreshed every month with new pregnancies added to the database, and previous records of ongoing pregnancies updated as required, for example if a woman has recently delivered her baby.

Further details on the COPS study are available on the [Usher Institute webpage](https://www.ed.ac.uk/usher/research/projects/covid-19-pregnancy-scotland) and [PHS github page](https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/COPS-public).

PHS has generated this information on COVID-19 vaccinations delivered to pregnant women by linking national data on vaccinations to the COVID-19 in Pregnancy in Scotland (COPS) study database of pregnant women in Scotland.

As part of the COPS study, PHS is regularly linking together a wide range of health records to identify women who are, or recently have been, pregnant.  The specific records used include:

- Records of booking for antenatal care
- GP records relating to miscarriage
- Hospital discharge records relating to miscarriage or delivery of a live or stillborn baby
- Statutory termination of pregnancy notification records
- Statutory live or stillbirth registration records
- NHS live birth notification records.

Using these records, we have identified all women in Scotland who were pregnant on 1 March 2020 (the start of the COVID-19 pandemic), and all women who have subsequently become pregnant.  

The study database is refreshed every month with new pregnancies added to the database, and previous records of ongoing pregnancies updated as required, for example if a woman has recently delivered her baby.

Further details on the COPS study are available on the [Usher Institute webpage](https://www.ed.ac.uk/usher/research/projects/covid-19-pregnancy-scotland) and [PHS github page](https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/COPS-public).

However, how some elements of maternity care are delivered has changed in order to minimise the number of visits women need to make. The ‘booking’ appointment is the first main appointment a woman has with her local maternity service once she knows she is pregnant. At the booking appointment, women are assessed by a midwife who can then tailor the subsequent care they receive during their pregnancy to their particular preferences and needs. Women are encouraged to book before they are 13 weeks pregnant, and ideally before they are 10 weeks pregnant. 

In general, prior to COVID-19, women were offered an initial in-person booking appointment (including various face to face tests such as blood tests and blood pressure monitoring) then a follow up appointment for their early pregnancy ultrasound scan. Since March 2020, in many areas women have been offered an initial remote consultation, then an in-person ‘one stop’ follow up appointment for all their face to face tests and their scan.

This dataset shows the number of women booking for antenatal care in each week from the week beginning 1 April 2019 onwards. In addition to the weekly data, monthly data (based on exact month of booking rather than summation of sequential weeks) is presented for each NHS Board of residence, including the Island Boards. Due to small numbers, weekly data is not shown for individual Island Boards of residence (NHS Orkney, NHS Shetland, and NHS Western Isles), however the Island Boards are included in the Scotland total.

As such, it has been provided throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, and maternity and neonatal staff have not been redeployed to support other services. The way that some elements of this care are provided has changed in response to COVID-19 however, to minimise the risk of infection and to allow services to continue to provide safe care during times when a high number of staff may be off work, for example due to needing to isolate. Relevant guidance has been issued by the Scottish Government, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, and the British Association for Perinatal Medicine.

‘Gestation at delivery’ refers to the number of completed weeks pregnant a woman is when she delivers her baby. Babies are ‘due’ at 40 completed weeks gestation. Those born between 37 and 41 weeks inclusive are considered to be born ‘at term’. Babies born at under 37 weeks (more than three weeks before their due date) are considered preterm or premature, with those born at under 32 weeks considered very preterm and those born at 32 to 36 weeks inclusive considered moderately preterm. Babies born at or over 42 weeks (more than two weeks after their due date) are considered post-term or over-due. Babies born preterm are at increased risk of both short and long term health and developmental problems, with the risk increasing the earlier a baby is born. Babies are also at increased risk when pregnancies extend post-term, in particular the risk of stillbirth increases from 42 weeks gestation onwards.

This dataset presents information on gestation at delivery. Data is shown at Scotland and NHS Board level, as well as broken down by age group and deprivation.

As such, it has been provided throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, and maternity staff have not been redeployed to support other services. The way that some elements of this care are provided has changed in response to COVID-19 however, to minimise the risk of infection and to allow services to continue to provide safe care during times when a high number of staff may be off work, for example due to needing to isolate.

Guidance issued by the Scottish Government and Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists to maternity services at the height of the first wave of the pandemic noted that:

•	It may be necessary for services to temporarily suspend the option for women to deliver at home or in midwife led units, and to concentrate delivery care within obstetric units

•	Additional restrictions on the use of water births were recommended

•	Care pathways for women requiring induction of labour should be amended to ensure the early stages of the induction process were delivered on an outpatient basis wherever possible

•	Services should consider deferring a planned induction of labour or elective caesarean section if a woman was isolating due to having COVID-19, or having been in contact with a case, if it was safe to do so

•	Services should support low risk women in the early latent phase of labour to remain at home wherever possible

•	In general, strict restrictions on visitors for patients in hospital were advised, however women giving birth could still be accompanied by their chosen birth partner

'Induction of labour' is when a woman is given a medical intervention to start her labour rather than waiting for labour to start spontaneously. It is offered because there are medical reasons meaning it is considered safer (for the mother or baby) for the baby to be born, or because a woman is past her ‘due date’. There are different approaches to inducing labour, for example using medicines, a medical ‘balloon’ device that sits at the neck of the womb, and/or breaking the woman’s waters.

This dataset shows information on induction of labour, presented at Scotland and NHS Board level. Scotland level data is also available by age group and deprivation category. The information on induction of labour presented in this dataset is taken from hospital discharge records, specifically records relating to the care of women delivering a singleton live birth (i.e. one baby, not twins or more) at 37-42 weeks gestation (i.e. up to 3 weeks before or after their due date).

COVID-19 Wider Impacts – Method of Delivery,Public Health Scotland,https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/covid-19-wider-impacts-method-of-delivery,https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/716b6a6f-1538-4e04-b058-42af9f1c4f44/resource/d1bd0441-c451-4aec-beaf-8506f704efec/download/method_delivery_simd_20220302.csv,2021-03-16,2022-03-02,Method of Delivery by Deprivation,,,CSV,,birth;c-section;caesarian;coronavirus;covid-19;delivery;induced birth;maternity;method of delivery;pregnancy,,Open Government Licence v3.0,"Care for women around the time they are giving birth is an essential, time critical service that cannot be deferred. As such, it has been provided throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, and maternity staff have not been redeployed to support other services. The way that some elements of this care are provided has changed in response to COVID-19 however, to minimise the risk of infection and to allow services to continue to provide safe care during times when a high number of staff may be off work, for example due to needing to isolate.

Guidance issued by the Scottish Government and Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists to maternity services at the height of the first wave of the pandemic noted that:

•	It may be necessary for services to temporarily suspend the option for women to deliver at home or in midwife led units, and to concentrate delivery care within obstetric units.

•	Additional restrictions on the use of water births were recommended.

•	Care pathways for women requiring induction of labour should be amended to ensure the early stages of the induction process were delivered on an outpatient basis wherever possible.

•	Services should consider deferring a planned induction of labour or elective caesarean section if a woman was isolating due to having COVID-19, or having been in contact with a case, if it was safe to do so.

•	Services should support low risk women in the early latent phase of labour to remain at home wherever possible.

•	In general, strict restrictions on visitors for patients in hospital were advised, however women giving birth could still be accompanied by their chosen birth partner.

The ‘method of delivery' refers to the way a baby is born. Different methods of delivery include spontaneous vaginal delivery (a natural birth); assisted vaginal delivery (including vaginal delivery by forceps or ventouse, or vaginal delivery of a breech baby); or a caesarean section (an operation to deliver the baby through a cut in the mother’s abdomen). A caesarean section can be elective (planned in advance and provided before labour has started) or emergency (unplanned, and usually but not always provided after labour has started).

This dataset shows information on method of delivery at Scotland and  NHS Board level. Age and deprivation breakdown is also available at Scotland level.

The COVID-19 pandemic has wider impacts on individuals’ health, and their use of healthcare services, than those that occur as the direct result of infection.
Reasons for this may include:

• Individuals being reluctant to use health services because they do not want to burden the NHS or are anxious about the risk of infection.

• The health service delaying preventative and non-urgent care such as some screening services and planned surgery.

• Other indirect effects of interventions to control COVID-19, such as mental or physical consequences of distancing measures.

This dataset provides information on trend data regarding the wider impact of the pandemic on Primary Care Out of Hours cases. The Primary Care Out of Hours service provides urgent access to a nurse or doctor, when needed at times outside normal general practice hours, such as evenings, overnight or during the weekend. An appointment to the service is normally arranged following contact with NHS 24.

Termination of pregnancy can be carried out as a medical procedure or, less commonly, a surgical procedure. Medical terminations involve the woman taking two different medicines 24-48 hours apart to end her pregnancy. Prior to October 2017, women having a medical termination were required to attend a clinic or hospital on two occasions to take the first and then, separately, the second medicine. From October 2017, women requiring an early medical termination (at up to 9 weeks and 6 days gestation) were able to take the second medicine away with them at the end of their first appointment, and subsequently take that at home. From 31 March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, women requiring an early medical termination (at up to 11 weeks and 6 days gestation) have been able to have an initial remote consultation, by telephone or video call, then take both medicines at home.

Termination of pregnancy (also referred to as a therapeutic or induced abortion) is provided under the terms of the Abortion Act 1967 and subsequent regulations. When a healthcare practitioner provides a termination of pregnancy, there is a legal requirement for them to notify the Chief Medical Officer of the termination within seven days of it taking place.

Termination of pregnancy can be carried out as a medical procedure or, less commonly, a surgical procedure. Medical terminations involve the woman taking two different medicines 24-48 hours apart to end her pregnancy. Prior to October 2017, women having a medical termination were required to attend a clinic or hospital on two occasions to take the first and then, separately, the second medicine. From October 2017, women requiring an early medical termination (at up to 9 weeks and 6 days gestation) were able to take the second medicine away with them at the end of their first appointment, and subsequently take that at home. From 31 March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, women requiring an early medical termination (at up to 11 weeks and 6 days gestation) have been able to have an initial remote consultation, by telephone or video call, then take both medicines at home.

Termination of pregnancy (also referred to as a therapeutic or induced abortion) is provided under the terms of the Abortion Act 1967 and subsequent regulations. When a healthcare practitioner provides a termination of pregnancy, there is a legal requirement for them to notify the Chief Medical Officer of the termination within seven days of it taking place. Public Health Scotland is responsible for the collation of data derived from notifications of terminations of pregnancy on behalf of the Chief Medical Officer. Detailed information on terminations is published each year by Public Health Scotland. The most recent report covers the year to December 2019.

This dataset provides data for COVID-19 hospital onset cases in Scotland for week ending 1 March 2020 onwards, as available.

COVID-19 cases first diagnosed within hospital in-patients are classed as hospital onset COVID-19, with the length of time between admission and the date of first positive test of new infections or reinfection episodes (90 days from previous COVID-19 positive result), determining their hospital onset status. 

ARHAI Scotland is working with NHS boards on a continuous basis to validate COVID-19 hospital onset cases to ensure the data are robust. Data are published on the Open Data platform at NHS Scotland level, by week of specimen date.

All publications and supporting material to this topic area can be found in the weekly Hospital onset COVID-19 cases in Scotland publication. Further information on the epidemiology of COVID-19 in healthcare settings can be found on the Public Health Scotland website.

The Covid-19 pandemic has had a detrimental impact on coverage of P1 reviews in 2019/20 as many of these had not been carried out prior to the closure of schools in March. Analysis of reviews for 2019/20 has shown that the Scotland level data is broadly representative of a ‘normal’ school year, nonetheless the low coverage means that Scotland level results shown should be treated with a degree of caution. Analysis of BMI distribution is shown for individual NHS Boards and local authorities where the coverage exceeds 50%, but is not shown for the areas with low coverage.

Glasgow CCTV Object Count Data,Glasgow City Council,https://open-data-design-glasgowgis.hub.arcgis.com/documents/GlasgowGIS::glasgow-cctv-object-count-data,https://api.ubdc.ac.uk/cctv/,,2022-03-14,,,,ARCGIS GEOSERVICE,,cctv;footfall;bicycles;vehicles,,No licence,"<p>Object Count data collected from over 40 CCTV cameras owned by Glasgow City Council. Since 2019, Urban Big Data Centre at University of Glasgow, Glasgow City Council and Glasgow Centre for Population Health have been collaborating on a project to combine Data Science with the city’s existing CCTV network to generate object count data.</p>  <p>Selected CCTV cameras take a single frame image every 30 minutes across the 40 plus cameras and the images are processed using machine learning algorithms to detect and count various objects – the objects include person, car, bicycle, motorcycle, bus and truck. The counts of objects in the frame are collected and returned via an API created to access and query the data.</p>  <p>Users can query the API to return data on object type, location and time periods since November 2019.</p>  <p>As the data detects objects only once every 30 minutes the data cannot be used to determine the absolute number of objects (such as persons) in one place over time. Rather the data should be used to compare the difference in object counts between places at the same time or the same image frame over two or more time periods.</p>  <span>Note that</span><span> the camera images do not store or track individual images of people, rather the algorithms are trained to recognise the outline shape of an object only and count it every time it detects the object in the image frame. One of the image count data are retained or stored after they have been counted.<br /></span>",DCAT feed,,;bicycles;footfall;cctv;vehicles,Public Safety
