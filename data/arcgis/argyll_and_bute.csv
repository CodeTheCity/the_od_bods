Any route across land or inland water can be a Core Path. The Core Paths Network as a whole should provide sufficient access opportunities for the full range of access takers, including walkers, cyclists and horse riders, of varying abilities. The network extends across the whole area with paths including trod paths across natural ground, farm and forest tracks as well as minor roads and footways beside public roads."

LAs also have a duty to keep these polling arrangements under review. The Electoral Administration Act 2006 introduced amendments to the 1983 Act (which in turn has been superseded by The Electoral Administration Act 2013). Now local authorities must conduct a full review (with public consultation) of its polling districts and polling places every four years, however adjustments to the boundaries of polling districts and the designation of polling places within LA wards can be proposed at any time in response to changes in ward boundaries or to the availability of premises that can be reasonably designated as polling places"
