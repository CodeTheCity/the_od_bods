AQMAs must be designated officially by means of an 'order'.  The extent of the AQMA may be limited to the area of exceedance or encompass a larger area.  Following the declaration of an AQMA, the local authority is required to develop and implement a plan (Air Quality Action Plan) to improve air quality in that area. AQMAs can be for a combination of NO2, SO2, PM10.  Most data provided by local authorities is in polygon format. However, some is provided in point and line form so we are currently buffering such data by the width of a road or so in order to merge them in to the national polygon dataset. Some smaller local authorities e.g. Dundee, use the entire extent of their local authority, as digitised in Ordnance Survey's BoundaryLine dataset, for the AQMA.  We have included date of AQMA declaration in our national schema, though many LAs do not currently provide this. Revoked AQMAs are now held in this dataset with a 'Date revoked' attribute"

The Direction, made by a local authority and approved by Scottish Ministers, removes all or some of the permitted development rights on an area.  The effect of a Direction is that planning permission will be required for specific types of development which would otherwise be regarded as 'permitted development', i.e. development that does not require a planning application. Directions can cover a variety of minor works and might include: the replacement of doors and windows, the erection of gates, fences, garages, sheds, porches, storage tanks or the installation of satellite antennae.  Article 4 Directions complement Conservation Areas and may overlap these.

The public will normally be consulted on any proposal to designate conservation areas or to change their boundaries. There are over 600 Conservation Areas in Scotland. Many were designated in the early 1970s, but some have since been re-designated, merged, renamed, given smaller or larger boundaries and new ones have been added.

It is a statement made under The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Scotland) Amendment Order 2011. The Direction, made by a local authority and approved by Scottish Ministers, removes all or some of the permitted development rights on an area.  The effect of a Direction is that planning permission will be required for specific types of development which would otherwise be regarded as 'permitted development', i.e. development that does not require a planning application. Directions can cover a variety of minor works and might include: the replacement of doors and windows, the erection of gates, fences, garages, sheds, porches, storage tanks or the installation of satellite antennae.  This dataset should be used in conjunction with the Article 4 Directions dataset also published on a Scotland-wide basis."

Core paths are paths, waterways or any other means of crossing land to facilitate, promote and manage the exercise of access rights under the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003, and are identified as such in access authority core paths plan.  There are, intentionally, no set physical standards for core paths. This means that core paths can physically be anything from a faint line across a field to a fully constructed path, track or pavement. The National Access Forum, Scottish Natural Heritage and Scottish Government are encouraging information to be surveyed and made publicly available, in a nationally-standardised form, so that the public will know what physical type of route they can expect. Government guidance is making core paths the priority for rolling out this national standardised grading system information, which is set out at https://www.pathsforall.org.uk/resources/resource/the-path-managers-guide-to-grading"

Some of the strategies are produced jointly across Councils, e.g. Stirling & Clackmannanshire, Edinburgh & Lothians, Glasgow Clyde Valley.  Generally, the FWS datasets contain similar attribution which identifies the FWS Classification, or the potential areas for woodland expansion.  The attribution is usually along the lines of: Preferred, Potential, Sensitive, Unsuitable.  Some of the councils have produced a few layers of data for their FWS which might apply specifically to woodland planting types, e.g. a separate FWS layer for native woodlands or for productive woodlands.  Please note the data has been created using data of different scales (regional/local) and has been created as a high level assessment tool. The data should be viewed NO larger than 1:25000. Identification as a preferred area does not imply automatic approval of woodland planting proposals. Applications will be assessed based on site conditions.

Principal third party data suppliers include:  - Ordnance Survey (greenspace and water body data)  - Scottish Government (Scotland’s Heat Map)  - Energy Saving Trust (Home Analytics)  Please reference the Data Guide and Methodology report (attached to the metadata record as an associated resource) and send any further queries on the quality/ accuracy of the data to parkpower@greenspacescotland.org.uk.   GHiGs Settlements:   A public summary of indicators for GHiGs analysis of low carbon heat based on data aggregated to Scotland’s 516 settlements. Settlement boundaries are from 2012 derived from National Records of Scotland to be consistent with those used by Scotland’s Heat Map v.2.

This, in turn, helps inform land releases within the Local Development Plan process and ongoing development management decisions. A five-year effective housing land supply is required at all times.  This dataset contains full details - where available - of site references, site size (hectares), capacity (in housing units), completions, remaining supply and annual forecast phasing over a period of years, also a record of past completions, including aggregations of 2009 and earlier and 2027 and beyond, where these have been grouped as such. Further details of greenfield/brownfield status, tenure, effectiveness (deliverable within the period), constraints, planning details/status and developer are also provided where available.  The datasets have been drawn from a variety of sources, including comprehensive regional datasets (ClydePlan) and the joining of spatial and tabular data. This includes allocated and planned sites, which typically have fuller details of forecast phasing (etc) and also ""windfall"" and small sites (where included), which may be one-off rather than longer-term developments, with less detail. Some of these sites lack spatial geometry and have been represented by a square buffer on a recorded X/Y easting/northing, based on site size, if this information is available."

For the purposes of planning applications, development in Scotland is put into one of three categories – 'local', 'major' or 'national'. The different categories mean that applications are treated in a way which is suited to the size and complexity of the proposed development and the issues they are likely to raise. Most applications will be for 'local' developments. 'Major' developments include applications for 50 or more homes, certain waste, water, transport and energy-related developments, and larger retail developments. 'National' developments are specific projects which have been identified in the National Planning Framework because of their national importance. Scottish Ministers become involved in a small minority of cases, but only do so where it involves a matter of genuine national interest.  This dataset consists of 3 separate layers:   1. Planning Applications - Weekly Lists (Points):  A point layer showing an amalgamation of the current calendar year's weekly lists for all Scottish planning authorities in terms of applications registered and/or decided by a planning authority. This should be a complete dataset across Scotland using X/Y co-ordinates, UPRN or postcode as corresponding geometry. This is categorised by application status, planning authority and date of weekly list. 2. Planning Applications - Weekly Lists (Polygons): A polygon layer showing an amalgamation of the current calendar year's weekly lists for most Scottish planning authorities in terms of applications registered and/or decided by a planning authority. This is only for authorities that publish site boundary mapping data online. This is categorised by application status, planning authority and date of weekly list. 3. Planning Applications - historic year layers back to 1990 (Polygons): Polygon layers for all previous year's planning applications with summary details for most Scottish planning authorities. This is only for authorities that publish site boundary mapping data online and is not complete across Scotland. NB. This layer can be filtered for individual year by selecting the 'shapefile' or 'GeoJSON' download option or the Web Feature Service can be filtered using appropriate software such as a desktop GIS.  This data is collected and published weekly (for weekly lists) and this metadata record is updated weekly.  We strongly recommend that, when using the WFS for this dataset, because of it's size you should use it with a filter.  *Moray and Aberdeenshire's planning data has currently been removed from this dataset. We will find a solution to this in due course*"

For the purposes of planning applications, development in Scotland is put into one of three categories – 'local', 'major' or 'national'. The different categories mean that applications are treated in a way which is suited to the size and complexity of the proposed development and the issues they are likely to raise. Most applications will be for 'local' developments. 'Major' developments include applications for 50 or more homes, certain waste, water, transport and energy-related developments, and larger retail developments. 'National' developments are specific projects which have been identified in the National Planning Framework because of their national importance. Scottish Ministers become involved in a small minority of cases, but only do so where it involves a matter of genuine national interest.  This dataset consists of 3 separate layers:   1. Planning Applications - Weekly Lists (Points):  A point layer showing an amalgamation of the current calendar year's weekly lists for all Scottish planning authorities in terms of applications registered and/or decided by a planning authority. This should be a complete dataset across Scotland using X/Y co-ordinates, UPRN or postcode as corresponding geometry. This is categorised by application status, planning authority and date of weekly list. 2. Planning Applications - Weekly Lists (Polygons): A polygon layer showing an amalgamation of the current calendar year's weekly lists for most Scottish planning authorities in terms of applications registered and/or decided by a planning authority.

Under section 79 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and Under part 6, section 37 of the Water Resources (Scotland) Act 2013 SEPA, Scottish Water and Local Authorities all have a responsibility for the registration, management and compliance of Septic Tanks within Scotland. The Scottish Assessors also currently identifies 678 septic tanks. These are tanks that serve more than one dwelling. Those that serve just one dwelling may be treated as an appurtenance of the dwelling i.e. they are classified as domestic and treated as being reflected in the Council Tax band.  SEPA have approximately a quarter of the Septic Tanks mapped as it has only been a requirement since 2012 that when buying or selling a house that these get licenced. Scottish Water have partial information (not included as data not provided in a suitable format) and Scottish Assessors collect some as well (not included due to percieved licensing restrictions). SEPA, Local Authorities, Scottish Water and Scottish Assessors are keen to combine data to create a complete and comprehensive view of all Septic Tanks in Scotland."

The survey has been operating since 1988. This survey is associated with the Scottish Vacant and Derelict Land Fund, under which cash allocations are made to local authorities.   Every year the Scottish Government Communities Analytical Services produce a comprehensive national survey based on data collected and processed from all Local Authorities and Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park Authority. The Spatial Hub takes this survey data and joins it (using site ID) to the polygon site information provided by local authorities.  To create this dataset we have taken all of the spatial data provided by councils and checked by the Scottish Government for the current survey year (2020 published in 2021) and combined it to this year's statistical survey (using the site reference). However:  - where local authorities have not provided spatial data for the current year, their previous spatial data return has been used.  - where there is no spatial data at all for sites we have buffered the easting and northing provided in the survey, to create a circular polygon area for a site."

However:  - where local authorities have not provided spatial data for the current year, we have used their previous spatial data return and matched the survey data as best we can, - where there is no spatial data at all for sites we have buffered the easting and northing provided in the survey, to create the rough polygon area for a site.

Further consideration will be required to demonstrate that any significant effects on the qualities of these areas can be substantially overcome by siting, design or other mitigation.  National and international designations: 		World Heritage Sites; 		Natura 2000 and Ramsar sites; 		Sites of Special Scientific Interest; 		National Nature Reserves; 		Sites identified in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes; 		Sites identified in the Inventory of Historic Battlefields.  Other nationally important mapped environmental interests: 		areas of wild land as shown on the 2014 NatureScot map of wild land areas; 		carbon rich soils, deep peat and priority peatland habitat.  Community separation for consideration of visual impact: an area not exceeding 2km around cities, towns and villages identified on the local development plan with an identified settlement envelope or edge. The extent of the area will be determined by the planning authority based on landform and other features which restrict views out from the settlement.  Group 3 - Area with potential for wind farm development:  Beyond groups 1 and 2, wind farms are likely to be acceptable, subject to detailed consideration against identified policy criteria. Reference should be made to Scottish Government planning and renewable energy policy. In the first instance, this is Scottish Planning Policy (June 2014) paragraphs 161 to 174, in the context of the overarching policy of ""A Low Carbon Place"".  It should be noted that some terminology relating to ""spatial frameworks"" and ""areas of search"" may no longer be in use, and reference should be made to planning advice on renewable energy (February 2017) at https://www.gov.scot/publications/renewables-planning-advice-index/"
