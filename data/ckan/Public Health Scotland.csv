Vaccine uptake statistics among care home residents and those who are severely immunosuppressed will be reported initially. PHS will include further updates as the Spring/Summer vaccination programme rolls out._  _In addition, as part of our continuous review of reporting, PHS made some changes to vaccine uptake statistics. From 24 March 2022, the deceased and those who no longer live in Scotland are no longer be included in vaccine uptake statistics.  Historic trend data have been updated to take into account this new methodology for all apart from the Daily Trends by JCVI Priority Group table (more details about the data in this table are below).  Scotland level data for all vaccinations administered (i.e. including those who have since died or moved from Scotland) are still available in the Daily Trend of All Vaccinations Delivered in Scotland table._  _Also from 24 March 2022, Dose 3/Booster doses are termed “Dose 3”._  **To allow new data to be fully processed and available at 14:00, the Daily COVID-19 in Scotland and COVID-19 Vaccination in Scotland datasets will be temporarily unavailable from 12:45 to 14:00. During this window, the datasets will not be visible and any queries made to these datasets will return a 404 – Not found error. At all other times the datasets will be available in full as usual.**  PHS reviewed the JCVI priority group uptake figures from 18 November 2021, specifically how we derive the numerator and the denominator.  The rational for the change is to ensure we report on most up to date living population for each group.  For this, the list of individuals in each cohort has been refreshed to be more current.  We have also removed individuals who have since died to reflect the current living population. From the 24 March 2022 those who are no longer living in Scotland have also been removed from the numerator and denominator for JCVI priority group uptake figures.  This means all the JCVI cohorts and populations have changed for both numerator and denominators on these two dates and care should be taken when interpreting trends.  On 08 December 2020, a Coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine developed by Pfizer BioNTech (Comirnaty) was first used in the UK as part of national immunisation programmes. The AstraZeneca (Spikevax) vaccine was also approved for use in the national programme, and rollout of this vaccine began on 04 January 2021. Moderna (Vaxzevria) vaccine was approved for use on 8 January 2021 and rollout of this vaccine began on 07 April 2021.  These vaccines have met strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness set out by the independent Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).   Those giving the vaccine to others were the first to receive the vaccination. In the first phase of the programme, NHS Scotland followed the independent advice received from the [Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI)](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/948353/Priority_groups_for_coronavirus__COVID-19__vaccination_-_advice_from_the_JCVI__2_December_2020.pdf) and prioritised delivery of the vaccine to those with the greatest clinical need, in line with the recommended order of prioritisation.  For booster vaccinations a similar approach has been adopted.   Definitions used in the vaccine uptake by JCVI priority group resource can be found in the [JCVI Priority Group Definitions table](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/covid-19-vaccination-in-scotland/resource/29e8ab8e-065a-4f92-ab70-4371d757633b). Individuals can appear in more than one JCVI priority group.  This dataset provides information on daily number of COVID vaccinations in Scotland. Data on the total number of vaccinations in Scotland is presented by day administered and vaccine type, by age group, by sex, by non-age cohorts and by geographies (NHS Board and Local Authority). As the population in the cohorts can change with time, these will be refined when updated data are available.  Additional data sources relating to this topic area are provided in the Links section of the Metadata below.  Data visualisation and additional notes are available on the [Public Health Scotland - Covid 19 Scotland dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/phs.covid.19/viz/COVID-19DailyDashboard_15960160643010/Overview). "

Clinical presentation may range from mild-to-moderate illness to pneumonia or severe acute respiratory infection. The COVID-19 pandemic has wider impacts on individuals’ health, and their use of healthcare services, than those that occur as the direct result of infection. Reasons for this may include:  • Individuals being reluctant to use health services because they do not want to burden the NHS or are anxious about the risk of infection.  • The health service delaying preventative and non-urgent care such as some screening services and planned surgery.  • Other indirect effects of interventions to control COVID-19, such as mental or physical consequences of distancing measures.   This dataset provides information on trend data regarding the wider impact of the pandemic on cardiovascular attendances in A&E departments. Data is available from the beginning of 2020 along with historical activity (average from 2018 and 2019) for comparison purposes.

As such, it has been provided throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, and maternity staff have not been redeployed to support other services. The way that some elements of this care are provided has changed in response to COVID-19 however, to minimise the risk of infection and to allow services to continue to provide safe care during times when a high number of staff may be off work, for example due to needing to isolate.  Guidance issued by the Scottish Government and Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists to maternity services at the height of the first wave of the pandemic noted that:  •	It may be necessary for services to temporarily suspend the option for women to deliver at home or in midwife led units, and to concentrate delivery care within obstetric units  •	Additional restrictions on the use of water births were recommended  •	Care pathways for women requiring induction of labour should be amended to ensure the early stages of the induction process were delivered on an outpatient basis wherever possible  •	Services should consider deferring a planned induction of labour or elective caesarean section if a woman was isolating due to having COVID-19, or having been in contact with a case, if it was safe to do so  •	Services should support low risk women in the early latent phase of labour to remain at home wherever possible  •	In general, strict restrictions on visitors for patients in hospital were advised, however women giving birth could still be accompanied by their chosen birth partner  'Induction of labour' is when a woman is given a medical intervention to start her labour rather than waiting for labour to start spontaneously. It is offered because there are medical reasons meaning it is considered safer (for the mother or baby) for the baby to be born, or because a woman is past her ‘due date’. There are different approaches to inducing labour, for example using medicines, a medical ‘balloon’ device that sits at the neck of the womb, and/or breaking the woman’s waters.  This dataset shows information on induction of labour, presented at Scotland and NHS Board level. Scotland level data is also available by age group and deprivation category. The information on induction of labour presented in this dataset is taken from hospital discharge records, specifically records relating to the care of women delivering a singleton live birth (i.e. one baby, not twins or more) at 37-42 weeks gestation (i.e. up to 3 weeks before or after their due date).  This data is also available on the [COVID-19 Wider Impact Dashboard](https://scotland.shinyapps.io/phs-covid-wider-impact/).
