Aberdeen City Rolls of Honour,Aberdeen City Council,https://data.aberdeencity.gov.uk/dataset/aberdeen-city-rolls-of-honour,https://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/services/libraries-and-archives/local-and-family-history,Local and Family History,2020-02-11 14:02:02.456017,2020-08-04 06:04:06.804252,78125.0,B,HTML,,Aberdeen;Military,,Open Government Licence 3.0 (United Kingdom),"The Roll of Honour for the **Great War** (later known as World War I or WWI) was compiled by the City Assessor, Mr H. G. Pope.  In early 1925, forms were sent to each householder in Aberdeen asking for full details of those relatives who had fallen during the conflict.  For military personnel, the details included rank, regiment and any military honours.  The forms also requested details of any non-combatants killed by enemy action and those in the **Mercantile Marine** (Merchant Navy - commercial/civilian vessels and crews that were engaged in activity supporting the Nation during times of war or those requisitioned and reassigned to military duties, such as minesweeping). The WWI Roll also drew together many separate lists provided by Churches, the University of Aberdeen, schools, guilds and businesses. The City Assessor was responsible for ensuring that no duplications existed. The final copy of the Roll contained over five thousand names.         Later, two dedicated volumes were created to commemorate lives lost during **World War II**. Volume One: **HM Forces and the Merchant Navy** and Volume Two: **Civil Defence and Civilians**. The separate volumes record slightly different information.          The **Post-1945** Roll varies in intent from the WWI and WWII volumes. This volume is hand-written, and records HM Forces lives lost in conflict and during active service, so includes those who lost their lives in Northern Ireland, for example.          The transcripts are an attempt to provide a structure to the data recorded in the City’s Rolls of Honour. Original copies of the WWI volume can be accessed in the Central Library, Aberdeen Art Gallery, and the Aberdeen City Archives. The WWII and Post-1945 volumes can be viewed in Aberdeen Art Gallery (McBey library on Level 1).

The Scottish Government then look at the indicators to measure the different sides of deprivation in each data zone including pupil performance, travel times to GP\u2019s, crime, unemployment etc. These 38 indicators of deprivation are then grouped into 7 types called domains.

If a patient's first positive PCR or LFD test of the episode of infection is after their date of discharge from hospital, they are not included in the analysis. \r\n\r\nInformation on COVID-19, including stay at home advice for people who are self-isolating and their households, can be found on\u202f[NHS Inform](https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/coronavirus-covid-19#stay-at-home-advice). \r\n\r\nData visualisation of Scottish COVID-19 cases is available on the\u202f[Public Health Scotland - Covid 19 Scotland dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/phs.covid.19/viz/COVID-19DailyDashboard_15960160643010/Overview). \r\n\r\nFurther information on coronavirus in Scotland is available on the\u202f[Scottish Government \u2013 Coronavirus in Scotland](https://www.gov.scot/coronavirus-covid-19/)\u202fpage, where further breakdown of\u202fpast [coronavirus data](https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-daily-data-for-scotland/)\u202fhas also been published. \r\n\r\n ",ckan API

Seven day positive cases and population rates are also presented by Neighbourhood Area (Intermediate Zone 2011). Information on how PHS publish small are COVID figures is available on the\u202f[PHS website](https://publichealthscotland.scot/our-areas-of-work/covid-19/covid-19-data-and-intelligence/covid-19-daily-cases-in-scotland-dashboard/how-we-publish-small-area-covid-figures/). \r\n\r\nInformation on demographic characteristics (age, sex, deprivation) of confirmed novel coronavirus (COVID-19) cases, as well as trend data regarding the wider impact of the virus on the healthcare system is provided in this publication. Data includes information on primary care out of hours consultations, respiratory calls made to NHS24, contact with COVID-19 Hubs and Assessment Centres, incidents received by Scottish Ambulance Services (SAS), as well as COVID-19 related hospital admissions and admissions to ICU (Intensive Care Unit). Further data on the wider impact of the COVID-19 response, focusing on hospital admissions, unscheduled care and volume of calls to NHS24, is available on the COVID-19 Wider Impact Dashboard.\r\n\r\nNovel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new strain of coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China. Clinical presentation may range from mild-to-moderate illness to pneumonia or severe acute respiratory infection. COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation on 12 March 2020. We now have spread of COVID-19 within communities in the UK. \r\n\r\n \r\nPublic Health Scotland no longer reports the number of COVID-19 deaths within 28 days of a first positive test from 2nd June 2022. Please refer to\u202f[NRS death certificate data](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/vital-events/general-publications/weekly-and-monthly-data-on-births-and-deaths/deaths-involving-coronavirus-covid-19-in-scotland)\u202fas the single source for COVID-19 deaths data in Scotland. \r\n \r\nTo allow new data to be fully processed and available at 12:00 on a Wednesday, the Daily COVID-19 in Scotland and COVID-19 Vaccination in Scotland datasets will be temporarily unavailable from 11:00 to 12:00. During this window, the datasets will not be visible and any queries made to these datasets will return a 404 \u2013 Not found error. At all other times the datasets will be available in full as usual. \r\n\r\nIn the process of updating the hospital admissions reporting to include reinfections, we have had to review existing methodology. In order to provide the best possible linkage of COVID-19 cases to hospital admissions, each admission record is required to have a discharge date, to allow us to better match the most appropriate COVID positive episode details to an admission. This means that in cases where the discharge date is missing (either due to the patient still being treated, delays in discharge information being submitted or data quality issues), it has to be estimated. Estimating a discharge date for historic records means that the average stay for those with missing dates is reduced, and fewer stays overlap with records of positive tests. \r\n\r\nThe result of these changes has meant that approximately 1,200 historic COVID admissions have been removed due to improvements in methodology to handle missing discharge dates, while approximately 820 have been added to the cumulative total with the inclusion of reinfections. \r\n\r\nCOVID-19 hospital admissions are now identified as the following: A patient's first positive PCR or LFD test of the episode of infection (including reinfections at 90 days or more) for COVID-19 up to 14 days prior to admission to hospital, on the day of their admission or during their stay in hospital.

Where both the infra-red beam and the piezo electric strips are triggered, the movement is a cyclist.  The piezo electric strips are installed below the surface of the footway and so when cut, will fail to record anything.**\r\n\r\n**In August 2019, the number of locations at which monitors are located increased to 23 with the addition of three sites around Craig\u2019s Roundabout. These were installed to allow the figures generated from them to be combined with those from the Kerse Road Bridge to provide origin-destination data for the network of pathways going through the roundabout.**\r\n\r\n[**Traffic Scotland **](https://trafficscotland.org/) **can provide updates on any road closures and the **[**Scottish Roadworks Commissioner **](https://www.roadworksscotland.org/)**can give further details on any planned roadworks throughout the country.**\r\n",ckan API

Any route across land or inland water can be a Core Path.

Following publication of the Scottish Executive’s Scottish Forestry Strategy 'Forests for Scotland' the opportunity was taken to review the Woodland Grant Scheme and the Farm Woodland Premium Scheme and give them a greater Scottish focus.     The Scottish Forestry Grant Scheme (SFGS) - encouraged the creation and management of woods and forests to provide economic, environmental and social benefits.    Grants were available under three main areas:    Grants for woodland expansion - creating new woodlands.Restocking grants, for replanting following felling.Stewardship grants, for a range of activities in existing woodlands.    Applications for SFGS grants started in June 2003 and closed in August 2006.    Most grants for SFGS were based on a percentage of Standard Costs of agreed operations. The Standard Cost took account of the costs of labour, plants, machinery, materials and supervision to do work to the specification as set out in the SFGS Standard Costs and Specifications Booklet.    Depending upon the level of public benefit, grant payments were either at 60% or 90% of the Standard Cost. In the case of restocking, Standard Costs were mostly pitched at 75% of the new planting Standard Costs.    Grants were available for planting proposals that met one or more of the following objectives:    Establishing well-designed productive woodland.Expanding areas of native woodland, preferably through natural regeneration and the development of Forest Habitat Networks.Improving riparian habitat.Improving the quality and setting of urban or post-industrial areas.Improving the diversity of the farmed and crofting landscape.

Basis III was introduced in 1974, providing grants for new planting and additional supplements for broadleaves.    The Dedication Scheme was closed to new applicants in 1981. Land still under Dedication could continue to be within the scheme but Dedication would terminate on a change of ownership.

Boundaries have been drawn around these groupings, and there will be a presumption in favour of developments within this boundary. (The settlement boundary policy E9 (LDP2015) will apply).The concept of identifying and promoting rural development in existing “rural communities” was originally contained in the 1993-98 Plan. At that time they were identified as small rural settlements, which served as social focal points for the surrounding area, with the presence of one or more community facilities (school/hall/shop).

Since 2019, Urban Big Data Centre at University of Glasgow, Glasgow City Council and Glasgow Centre for Population Health have been collaborating on a project to combine Data Science with the city’s existing CCTV network to generate object count data.</p>  <p>Selected CCTV cameras take a single frame image every 30 minutes across the 40 plus cameras and the images are processed using machine learning algorithms to detect and count various objects – the objects include person, car, bicycle, motorcycle, bus and truck. The counts of objects in the frame are collected and returned via an API created to access and query the data.</p>  <p>Users can query the API to return data on object type, location and time periods since November 2019.</p>  <p>As the data detects objects only once every 30 minutes the data cannot be used to determine the absolute number of objects (such as persons) in one place over time. Rather the data should be used to compare the difference in object counts between places at the same time or the same image frame over two or more time periods.</p>  <span>Note that</span><span> the camera images do not store or track individual images of people, rather the algorithms are trained to recognise the outline shape of an object only and count it every time it detects the object in the image frame. One of the image count data are retained or stored after they have been counted.<br /></span>",DCAT feed
